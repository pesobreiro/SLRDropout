AB In business environments where an organization offers contract-based
   periodic services to its clients, one crucial task is to predict changes
   in revenues generated through different clients or specific service
   offerings from one time epoch to another. This is commonly known as the
   revenue change prediction problem. In practical real-world environments,
   the importance of having adequate revenue change prediction capability
   primarily stems from scarcity of resources (in particular, sales team
   personnel or technical consultants) that are needed to respond to
   different revenue change scenarios including predicted revenue growth or
   shrinkage. It becomes important to make actionable decisions; that is,
   decisions related to prioritizing clients or service offerings to which
   these scarce resources are to be allocated. The contribution of the
   current work is twofold. First, we propose a framework for conducting
   revenue change prediction through casting it as a classification
   problem. Second, since datasets associated with revenue change
   prediction are typically imbalanced, we develop a new methodology for
   solving the classification problem such that we achieve maximum
   prediction precision while minimizing sacrifice in prediction accuracy.
   We validate our proposed framework through real-world datasets acquired
   from a major global provider of cloud computing services, and benchmark
   its performance against standard classifiers from previous works in the
   literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Customer churn management focuses on identifying potential churners and
   implementing incentives that can cure churn. The success of a churn
   management program depends on accurately identifying potential churners
   and understanding what conditions contribute to churn. However, in the
   presence of uncertainties in the process of churn, such as competing
   risks and unpredictable customer behaviour, the accuracy of the
   prediction models can be limited. To overcome this, we employ a
   competing risk methodology within a random survival forest framework
   that accurately computes the risks of churn and identifies relationships
   between the risks and customer behaviour. In contrast to existing
   methods, the proposed model does not rely on a specific functional form
   to model the relationships between risk and behaviour, and does not have
   underlying distributional assumptions, both of which are limitations
   faced in practice. The performance of the method is evaluated using data
   from a membership-based firm in the hospitality industry, where
   customers face two competing churning events. The proposed model
   improves prediction accuracy by up to 20%, compared to conventional
   models. The findings from this work can allow marketers to identify and
   understand churners, and develop strategies on how to design and
   implement incentives.

AB Opinion mining and sentiment analysis are useful to extract subjective
   information out of bulk text documents. Predicting the customer's
   opinion on amazon products has several benefits like reducing customer
   churn, agent monitoring, handling multiple customers, tracking overall
   customer satisfaction, quick escalations, and upselling opportunities.
   Though performing sentiment analysis is a challenging task for the
   researchers to identify the user's sentiments from the large datasets,
   it is unstructured in nature, and also includes slangs, misspells, and
   abbreviations. To address this problem, a new proposed system is
   developed in this research study. Here, the proposed system comprises of
   four major phases; they are data collection, pre-processing, keyword
   extraction, and classification. Initially, the input data were collected
   from the dataset: amazon customer review. After collecting the data,
   pre-processing was carried out for enhancing the quality of collected
   data. The pre-processing phase comprises of three systems:
   lemmatization, review spam detection, and removal of stop words and
   URLs. Then, an effective topic modelling approach latent Dirichlet
   allocation along with modified possibilistic fuzzy C-Means was applied
   to extract the keywords and also helps in identifying the concerned
   topics. The extracted keywords were classified into three forms
   (positive, negative, and neutral) by applying an effective machine
   learning classifier: Selective memory architecture-based convolutional
   neural network. The experimental outcome showed that the proposed system
   enhanced the accuracy in sentiment analysis up to 6-20% related to the
   existing systems.

AB Network Service Provider (NSP), loosely defined as an organization that
   provides IP Network Transport as a service to either direct consumers or
   to other value add businesses. NSPs have struggled to reduce subscriber
   churn which we define as customers switching from current NSP to another
   competitor NSP due to dissatisfaction, for our purposes specifically
   dissatisfaction of network performance, such as excess latencies or
   downtime. The focus of this paper is reliability and maintenance, in
   particular network resiliency and operations. In the context of this
   paper, network resiliency is defined as the rate of taking corrective
   action due to an exogenous network disturbance or event that materially
   impacts the network service level as experienced by users. Operators not
   only want to mitigate this period of unsatisfactory network service but
   want to avoid it altogether, at the lowest possible operational costs by
   proactively monitoring user network experience, to detect anomalies and
   resolve by automatic root cause determination and ultimately restore
   satisfactory network service levels. However, in contrast, today, NSPs
   operate reactively, by employing teams of expensive network engineers,
   that manually sift through massive amounts of data to determine root
   causes either as a result of subscribers complaining about poor service
   (after customer impact) or triggered network alarms that may be a
   symptom of a more complex underlying root cause, or often noise, not
   materially impacting users. In this paper we evaluate standard machine
   learning approaches in extracting root causes and explain a key
   underlying reason for poor accuracy. The proposed contribution to
   improve accuracy, is a novel approach using a multi-tier ensemble
   machine learning approach that dynamically adapts to changing network
   data features sets or characteristics combinations to yield accurate
   causal estimations. It is due the complex interactions of different
   characteristics combinations that impact different algorithms to yield
   different accurate results. Results show that our approach improves
   customer experience and network operations by automatically detecting
   customer impacting network anomalies and identifying root causes with
   increased accuracy of 65.3% over any single machine learning approach.

AB Online learning has been adopted rapidly by educational institutions and
   organizations. Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high
   flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from
   high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes.
   Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers
   proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that
   they might address to help students continue their learning experience.
   Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with
   three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit
   leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a
   real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based
   online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in
   finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility.
   Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel
   benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research
   specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom
   characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement
   variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results
   show that different insights emerge for various student segments with
   different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to
   personalize student retention campaigns.

AB Customer retention campaigns increasingly rely on predictive models to
   detect potential churners in a vast customer base. From the perspective
   of machine learning, the task of predicting customer churn can be
   presented as a binary classification problem. Using data on historic
   behavior, classification algorithms are built with the purpose of
   accurately predicting the probability of a customer defecting. The
   predictive churn models are then commonly selected based on accuracy
   related performance measures such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
   However, these models are often not well aligned with the core business
   requirement of profit maximization, in the sense that, the models fail
   to take into account not only misclassification costs, but also the
   benefits originating from a correct classification. Therefore, the aim
   is to construct churn prediction models that are profitable and
   preferably interpretable too. The recently developed expected maximum
   profit measure for customer churn (EMPC) has been proposed in order to
   select the most profitable churn model. We present a new classifier that
   integrates the EMPC metric directly into the model construction. Our
   technique, called ProfTree, uses an evolutionary algorithm for learning
   profit driven decision trees. In a benchmark study with real-life
   datasets from various telecommunication service providers, we show that
   ProfTree achieves significant profit improvements compared to classic
   accuracy driven tree-based methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Customer retention is one of the key challenges in the telecommunication
   industry. Companies may find customer churn prediction to be vital to
   the success of their operations because a careful analysis of churning
   may provide a crucial means to retain customers. Among potentially a
   vast amount of factors that impact the churn, it is critical to identify
   the most influential ones towards which customer retention efforts can
   be directed. In this paper, we compare the performance of different
   churn prediction models based on the real data obtained from a partner
   company. The prediction models include logistic regression, support
   vector machines, random forest, and decision tree. Furthermore, the
   push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework is utilized to study the effect of
   features on customers churn behavior from push, pull, and mooring
   perspectives. A partial least squares (PLS) regression is used to
   perform the PPM analysis. Furthermore, the behavior or churners and
   non-churners are analyzed. The results show that the logistic regression
   has the highest prediction accuracy, and the drop-percentage push factor
   is found to be one of the most influential factors affecting the
   customer churn, as churners are more sensitive to service quality than
   non-churners.

AB Customer churn is a problem for most companies because it affects the

   company to another in the telecom sector. For solving this problem we
   put two main approaches: the first one is identifying the main factors
   that affect customers churn, the second one is detecting the customers
   that have a high probability to churn through analyzing social media.
   For the first approach we build a dataset through practical
   questionnaires and analyzing them by using machine learning algorithms
   like Deep Learning, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes algorithms. The
   second approach is customer churn prediction model through analyzing
   their opinions through their user-generated content (UGC) like comments,
   posts, messages, and products or services' reviews. For analyzing the
   UGC we used Sentiment analysis for finding the text polarity
   (negative/positive). The results show that the used algorithms had the
   same accuracy but differ in arrangement of attributes according to their
   weights in the decision.

AB Remanufacturing has received increasing attention from researchers over
   the last decade. While many associated operational issues have been
   extensively studied, research into the prediction customer demand for,
   and the market development of, remanufactured products is still in its
   infancy. The majority of the existing research into remanufactured
   product demand is largely based on conventional statistical models that
   fail to capture the non-linear behaviour of customer demand and market
   factors in real-world business environments, in particular
   e-marketplaces. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a comprehensible
   data-mining prediction approach, in order to achieve two objectives: (1)
   to provide a highly accurate and robust demand prediction model of
   remanufactured products: and (2) to shed light on the non-linear effect
   of online market factors as predictors of customer demand. Based on the
   realworld Amazon dataset, the results suggest that predicting
   remanufactured product demand is a complex, non-linear problem, and
   that, by using advanced machine-learning techniques, our proposed
   approach can predict the product demand with high accuracy. In terms of
   practical implications, the importance of market factors is ranked
   according to their predictive powers of demand, while their effects on
   demand are analysed through their partial dependence plots. Several
   insights for management are revealed by a thorough comparison of the
   sales impact of these market factors on remanufactured and new products.

AB Predicting future customer behavior provides key information for

   this paper, we develop advanced analytics tools that predict future

   and data driven framework for predicting whether a customer is going to
   make purchase at the company within a certain time frame in the near
   future. For that purpose, we propose a new set of customer relevant
   features that derives from times and values of previous purchases. These
   customer features are updated every month, and state of the art machine
   learning algorithms are applied for purchase prediction. In our studies,
   the gradient tree boosting method turns out to be the best performing
   method. Using a data set containing more than 10000 customers and a

AB Finding structural and efficient ways of leveraging available data is
   not an easy task, especially when dealing with network data, as is the
   case in telco churn prediction. Several previous works have made
   advancements in this direction both from the perspective of churn
   prediction, by proposing augmented call graph architectures, and from
   the perspective of graph featurization, by proposing different graph
   representation learning methods, frequently exploiting random walks.
   However, both graph augmentation as well as representation
   learning-based featurization face drawbacks. In this work, we first
   shift the focus from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous perspective, by
   defining different probabilistic meta paths on augmented call graphs.
   Secondly, we focus on solutions for the usually significant number of
   random walks that graph representation learning methods require. To this
   end, we propose a sampling method for random walks based on a
   combination of most suitable random walk generation strategies, which we
   determine with the help of corresponding Markov models. In our
   experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of probabilistic
   meta path-based walk generation in terms of predictive power. In
   addition, this paper provides promising insights regarding the interplay
   of the type of meta path and the predictive outcome, as well as the
   potential of sampling random walks based on the meta path structure in
   order to alleviate the computational requirements of representation
   learning by reducing typically sizable required data input.

AB Repair and maintenance services are among the most lucrative aspects of
   the entire automobile business chain. However, in the context of fierce
   competition, customer chums have led to the bankruptcy of several 4S
   (sales, spare parts, services, and surveys) shops. In this regard, a
   six-year dataset is utilized to study customer behaviors to aid managers
   identify and retain valuable but potential customer churn through a
   customized retention solution. First, we define the absence and presence
   behaviors of customers and thereafter generate absence data according to
   customer habits; this makes it possible to treat the customer absence
   prediction problem as a classification problem. Second, the repeated
   absence and presence behaviors of customers are considered as a whole
   from a lifecycle perspective. A modified recurrent neural network
   (RNN-2L) is proposed; it is more efficient and reasonable in structure
   compared with traditional RNN. The time-invariant customer features and
   the sequential lifecycle features are handled separately; this provides
   a more sensible specification of the RNN structure from a behavioral
   interpretation perspective. Third, a customized retention solution is
   proposed.
   By comparing the proposed model with those that are conventional, it is
   found that the former outperforms the latter in terms of area under the
   curve (AUC), confusion matrix, and amount of time consumed. The proposed
   customized retention solution can achieve significant profit increase.
   This paper not only elucidates the customer relationship management in
   the automobile aftermarket (where the absence and presence behaviors are
   infrequently considered), but also presents an efficient solution to
   increase the predictive power of conventional machine learning models.
   The latter is achieved by considering behavioral and business
   perspectives.

   into a decision support system where decision makers can make
   predictions regarding future payments, and take actions as necessary
   toward the collection of potentially unpaid debt, or adjust their
   financial plans based on the expected invoice-to-cash amount. In our

   customers and their invoice and payment history, as well as various
   actions (e.g., e-mail, short message service, phone call) performed by
   the invoice-issuing company toward customers to encourage payment. We
   use supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to help predict
   whether a customer will pay the invoice or outstanding balance by the
   next due date based on the actions generated by the company and the
   customer's response. We propose a novel behavioral scoring model used as

   learning approaches tested, we report the results of logistic regression
   that provides up to 97% accuracy with or without preclustering of
   customers. Such a model has a high potential to help decision makers in
   generating actions that contribute to the financial stability of the
   company in terms of cash flow management and avoiding unnecessary
   corporate lines of credit.

AB Nowadays, customer analytics plays a fundamental role in the commercial
   activity of a financial company, which is interested to deliver the best
   products and services to consumers. However, sometimes things may
   possibly go wrong, resulting in inconveniences experienced by the
   clients, who may eventually decide to end the relationship with a bank.
   This study uses a dataset which contains a bank's customer base who
   churned, with a series of variables regarding socio-demographic
   characteristics, member activity, balance, estimated salary and tenure.
   An issue of general interest in banking field is predicting the
   probability of churn or attrition, a phenomenon which may lead to
   significant decreasing of revenues if the company fails to act on time.
   Therefore, in this paper we examine which are the main characteristics
   of customers that influence the propensity to churn by means of an
   exploratory data analysis. Moreover, we employ two machine learning
   algorithms and use an optimization technique called Grid Search to
   obtain the optimal predictive model, which can estimate the likelihood
   of a customer leaving a bank in the future. Ultimately, we use the Area
   Under the Curve (AUC) as model performance metric to compare the
   outcomes of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers on the
   test dataset. Final results show that Random Forest classifier
   outperformed Logistic Regression model in terms of AUC values and, at
   the same time,the outcomes emphasize different behaviors between
   countries.

   learning technique was based on call detail records (CDR) describing
   customers activity during two-month traffic from a real

   business use case by considering each subscriber as a single input image
   describing the churning state. Different experiments were performed to
   evaluate the performance of the method. The authors found that deep
   convolutional neural networks (DCNN) outperformed other traditional
   machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forest, and
   gradient boosting classifier) with F1 score of 91%. Thus, the use of
   this approach can reduce the cost related to customer loss and fits

   machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can
   be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on
   prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast
   client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost
   before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to
   provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as
   an effort to ensure their retention.
   We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is
   represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the
   length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a
   period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3)
   how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds
   that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict,
   well in advance, which clients will be lost. This knowledge permits a
   company to focus marketing efforts on such clients as early as three
   months in advance.

AB Players in the telecommunications sector struggle against the
   competition to keep customers, and therefore they need effective churn
   management. Most classification algorithms either ignore
   misclassification cost or assume that the costs of all incorrect
   classification errors are equal. But as in real life, many
   classification problems have different misclassification costs and this
   difference cannot be ignored. For this reason, studies on cost-sensitive
   classification approaches have gained importance in recent years. The
   characteristics of telecommunications datasets such as high
   dimensionality and imbalance are making it difficult to achieve the
   desired performance for churn prediction. By taking this into
   consideration, we propose a multiobjective-cost-sensitive ant colony
   optimization (MOC-ACO-Miner) approach which integrates the cost-based
   nondominated sorted genetic algorithm feature selection and
   multiobjective ACO based cost-sensitive learning. MOC-ACO-Miner is
   applied to one of Turkey's top 100 information technology companies for
   customer churn-prediction. Finally, experiments find out that the model
   performs quite well with the area under receiver operating
   characteristic curve values of 0.9998 for predicting churners and
   therefore it can be beneficial for the highly competitive
   telecommunications sector. This article is categorized under:

   data mining approaches to churn prediction in telecommunications
   industry are based on detecting patterns from customer contractual
   information, traffic related data, bills and payments, CRM data and
   customer service logs. The study presented in this paper has employed
   various machine learning approaches and assessed their performances
   using the data of a European mobile operator. The feature importance
   rankings which were used for feature selection yielded also some initial
   guidelines for acting on churn prevention in practice.

AB Customer churn prediction is one of the most important issues in search
   ads business management, which is a multi-billion market. The aim of
   churn prediction is to detect customers with a high propensity to leave
   the ads platform, then to do analysis and increase efforts for retaining
   them ahead of time. Ensemble model combines multiple weak models to
   obtain better predictive performance, which is inspired by human
   cognitive system and is widely used in various applications of machine
   learning. In this paper, we investigate how the ensemble model of
   gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to predict whether a customer
   will be a churner in the foreseeable future based on its activities in
   the search ads. We extract two types of features for the GBDT: dynamic
   features and static features. For dynamic features, we consider a
   sequence of customers' activities (e.g., impressions, clicks) during a
   long period. For static features, we consider the information of
   customers setting (e.g., creation time, customer type). We evaluated the
   prediction performance in a large-scale customer data set from Bing Ads
   platform, and the results show that the static and dynamic features are
   complementary, and get the AUC (area under the curve of ROC) value
   0.8410 on the test set by combining all features. The proposed model is
   useful to predict those customers who will be churner in the near future
   on the ads platform, and it has been successfully daily run on the Bing
   Ads platform.

   hand-crafted features, such as logistic regression (LR), support vector
   machines (SVM), random forests (RF) and neural networks (NN) in terms of
   accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)
   and top-decile lift. Furthermore, we found that after adding the
   demographic data feature to the basic CNN model, the performance of the
   FE-CNN model improved. Overall, we found that the FE-CNN is the most
   powerful way to solve the problem of customer churn prediction in the
   Internet funds industry. Our FE-CNN method can also be applied to other
   fields that have both dynamic data and static data.

AB Retention of customer improves the profit growth of a marketing firm.
   Customer retention is the process of identifying and retaining the
   customers who are about to slide from one brand to another on any
   dissatisfaction. Customer Correlation Management (CCM) process helps the
   organization in this retention of customer. A company which performs the
   retention of customer efficiently is achieving a high market value.
   Nowadays, customer retention is highly required in the telecommunication
   systems as the sliding of customers from one provider to the other is
   increasing. Earlier this customer retention was made using single
   classification techniques which were less efficient than the hybrid
   models. Clustering the customers who all belong to similar
   characteristics into groups and then classifying each group is called
   the hybrid model. Further to improve the classification in our hybrid
   model, ensemble techniques are used, which are more efficient. In the
   first phase, fuzzy-based clustering methods such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM),
   Possibility C-Means (PCM), and Possibility Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) are used
   for clustering the customers into groups. In the second phase, those
   clustered groups are partitioned into training and testing data using
   holdout. In the third phase, the training data are given to ensemble
   models like bagging, boosting, and Random Subspace (RS) algorithms for
   building the model. The test data are predicted based on the majority
   voting, provided by the ensemble techniques. Through this analysis, it
   is found that the proposed fuzzy clustering with ensemble classification
   techniques provides more accuracy than single classifier and clustering
   with base classifier.

AB Migration of customer to other companies is "Churn". Customers who
   abandon services of any company or leave the organization are known as
   churners. Now a day churn prediction is one of the biggest challenge for
   organizations/Companies. Reputation/Ranking, finance and growth plans of
   company is directly affected by churn. This makes research on churn more
   valuable. In this paper python platform is used to implement two of the
   classification models of supervised machine learning. As the data used
   is a labeled data thus this is under the category of supervised domain
   of machine learning. Confusion matrix is observed to state the
   conclusion which says that KNN is a better approach to predict customer
   churn over Logistic Regression. KNN is 2.0% more accurate than Logistic
   Regression to predict customer churn. here "accuracy" parameter says
   that Logistic algorithm is least effective to predict the customer churn
   as compare to K-Nearest Neighbors.

AB Subscription Fraud (SF) is one of the hardest and most expensive revenue
   leakage to prevent. This fraud is the leading revenue leakage in
   telecommunication. The tough economic challenges and saturated
   telecommunication market in South Africa makes it difficult for
   telecommunication companies to invest in good fraud prevention systems
   since their main focus is to increase earnings before interest tax and
   amortization (EBITA). Most fraud analysts determine the revenue impact
   of SF on the companies, but less focus is given to the impact on the
   customer. In this paper, we determine the impact of SF on company's
   revenue, churn and customers. The common use of machine learning
   techniques in telecommunication fraud detection and prevention has been
   very successful. We used decision tree model to predict SF using
   post-paid customers data, the model correctly predicted 98 percent of
   fraud cases and highlighted high monthly subscription fees and payment
   types as key attributes to the model for predicting fraud, the model
   further indicated that 30 percent of revenue loss is caused by SF.
   Information presented in this paper may be used to develop predicting
   models and also shows a need to develop a solution to vet the customers
   before contract can be approved.

AB A new method for customer churn analysis and prediction has been
   proposed. The method uses data mining model in banking industries. This
   has been inspired by the fact that there are around 1,5 million churn
   customers in a year which is increasing every year. Churn customer
   prediction is an activity carried out to predict whether the customer
   will leave the company or not. One way to predict this customer churn is
   to use a classification technique from data mining that produces a
   machine learning model. This study tested 5 different classification
   methods with a dataset consisting of 57 attributes. Experiments were
   carried out several times using comparisons between different classes.
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a comparison of 50:50 Class sampling
   data is the best method for predicting churn customers at a private bank
   in Indonesia. The results of this modeling can be utilized by company
   who will apply strategic action to prevent customer churn.

   this paper, we use deep learning based customer churn analysis to
   establish a predictive model of customer churn, to achieve a warning
   real time. We use stacked autoencoder network to extract features from
   the data and then use logistic regression( LR) to classify customers. We
   first pretrain stacked autoencoder network, which is a deep learning
   model that uses the greedy layerwise unsupervised learning algorithm to
   train. After pretraining each layer separately, we will stack the each
   layer to form stacked autoencoder network, using backpropagation( BP)
   algorithm to reverse tuning parameters, and then train the logistic
   regression layer. From the perspective of overall accuracy, we use
   accuracy to evaluate the model, if the company pays more attention to
   all the churner to be predicted, we use the recall to evaluate the
   model, if the company pays more attention to the predicted accuracy of
   the churner, we can use the precision to evaluate the model. As to the
   customers who predict the loss, change the shortages in the operation
   timely, and reduce the loss of customers.

AB In real-life scenarios, manual labeling is costly and inefficient.
   besides sometimes there is privacy restrictions on the user's
   information, which makes it difficult to detect customers losses in the
   mobile customer field. We cannot directly obtain information about a
   user is lost or not. However, the business manager can estimate the
   proportion of lost users based on his business experience. Besides,
   considering that the proportion information we obtain in reality is
   estimated and not completely accurate, we propose a soft label
   proportional learning method based on the learning from label
   proportions (LLP). In detail, we modify proportional loss term in the
   loss function by introducing a slack variable. In this way, the
   proportional loss within a certain range can be regarded as zero when
   the estimated proportional information is uncertain. The proportional
   information can be determined in a range by adjusting the parameter. The
   experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method,
   which provides a new way to effectively solve the problem of customer
   churn analysis in the field of mobile communication. (C) 2020 The

AB Customer retention is invariably the top priority of all consumer
   businesses, and certainly it is one of the most critical challenges as
   well. Identifying and gaining insights into the most probable cause of
   churn can save from five to ten times in terms of cost for the company
   compared with finding new customers. Therefore, this study introduces a
   full-fledged geodemographic segmentation model, assessing it, testing
   it, and deriving insights from it. A bank dataset consisting 11,000
   instances, which consists of 10,000 instances for training and 10,000
   instances for testing, with 14 attributes, has been used, and the
   likelihood of a person staying with the bank or leaving the bank is
   computed with the help of logistic regression. Base on the proposed
   model, insights are drawn and recommendations are provided. Stepwise
   logistic regression methods, namely, backward elimination method,
   forward selection method, and bidirectional model are constructed and
   contrasted to choose the best among them. Future forecasting of the
   models has been done by using cumulative accuracy profile (CAP) curve
   analysis.

AB Switching of customers from one service provider to another service
   provider is known as customer churn. With the surge of the technologies
   and increased customer awareness, retaining customers has become vital
   for a company's growth. Several studies have been carried out to keep a
   check on the customer churn of companies and analyze churn prediction
   but the accuracy rate is not up to the mark. Recently with the extensive
   research in the field of Artificial Intelligence it has become possible
   to dig to the core of the factor responsible for customer churn. We
   present an effective solution to this challenging problem of customer
   churn prediction using the data set of telecommunication industry and
   Artificial Neural Networks to determine the factors influencing the
   customer churn and optimize the solutions by experimenting with
   different activation functions.

AB Nowadays, recommendation systems are widely deployed to suggest a
   variety of products and services for target users. Practical examples of
   recommendation systems that we daily encounter include social,
   educational, and political services such as academic courses, movies,
   travel, music, and news feed on the web. Current recommendation systems
   can be categorized into threefold: knowledge-based, collaborative
   filtering, and content-based systems. Knowledge-based recommendation
   systems are based on domain knowledge without user-specific data.
   Collaborative filtering provides recommendations based on existing
   user's historical record, which can be a problem when the user is new to
   the platform. Content-based recommendations build models based on a
   number of records on product transactions. In this paper, we introduce
   the three recommendation systems, then suggest a new strategy that
   integrates domain knowledge for new users into a machine learning based
   recommendation system for existing users. We also propose an
   offline/online evaluation strategy to reduce customer churn, which
   enables the deployment of accurate recommendations for both new and
   existing users. Using the movie Tweetings dataset, we implement each
   recommendation system and generate a boosted system which addresses the
   issues caused by current recommendation systems.

AB For telecommunication service providers, a principle method for reducing
   costs and generating revenue is to focus on retaining existing customers
   rather than acquiring new customers. To support this strategy, it is
   important to understand customer concerns as early as possible to
   prevent churn: The customer action of canceling a subscription and
   moving to a new provider. In this paper, we use actual customer phone
   call data and develop the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
   predictive model to detect churn signals from transcript data of phone
   calls. Experimental results show that when sufficient training data is
   provided with our text annotation method, our CNN-based predictive model

AB The interest in customer relationship management has been fueled by the
   broad adoption of customer-centric paradigm, rapid growth in data
   collection, and technology advances for more than the past 15 years. It
   becomes hard to identify and interpret meaningful patterns in customer
   behavior; thus the goal of the paper is to compare multiple explanatory
   variable selection procedures and their effect on a customer churn
   prediction model. Filter and wrapper concepts of variable selection are
   examined, moreover, the runtime of the machine learning pipeline is
   improved by the novel idea of balanced clustering. Classification
   learners are incorporated with regard to simplicity and interpretability
   (LOGIT, CIT) and complexity and proven performance on a given dataset
   (RF, RBF-SVM). In addition, we show that when combined with learner
   capable of embedded feature selection, explicit variable selection
   scheme does not necessarily lead to performance improvement. On the
   other hand, RBF-SVM learner with no such ability benefits from relevant
   selection procedure in all expected aspects, including classification
   performance and runtime, problem comprehensibility, data storage.

AB Customer based companies are concerned about costumers who decide to
   stop using their services (churn) because the cost of acquiring new
   customer is much higher than satisfying an existing customer. With the
   rapid development of the telecom industry, churn prediction emerges as
   one of the fundamental tasks for gaining the competitive advantage in
   the market. This paper introduces Selective Ensemble Model (SEM) as a
   powerful technique for churn prediction. Among a set of machine learning
   models, SEM dynamically selects a combination of models to participate
   in forming the final outcome. Experimental results show that SEM
   outperforms its constituent models and the averaging ensemble model.

AB The telecoms industry is a highly competitive sector which is constantly
   challenged by customer churn or attrition. In order to remain steadfast
   in the consumer business, companies need to have sophisticated churn
   management strategies that will harness valuable data for business
   intelligence. Data mining and machine learning are tools which can be
   used by telecoms companies to monitor the churn behaviour of customers.
   This study implemented exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
   in a public domain Telecoms dataset and applied seven (7) classification
   techniques namely, Naive Bayes, Generalized Linear Model, Logistic
   Regression, Deep Learning, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient
   Boosted Trees. The results are analyzed using different metrics such as
   Accuracy, Classification error, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.
   This study discussed how these results are essential in reducing
   customer churn and improving customer service. The results obtained in
   the experiment demonstrate that the best classifier is Gradient Boosted
   Trees. It outperforms the other classifiers in almost all evaluation
   metrics. Further, all classifiers showed remarkable improved performance
   after the oversampling method is applied.

AB In the telecom sector, a huge volume of data is being generated on a
   daily basis due to a vast client base. Decision makers and business
   analysts emphasized that attaining new customers is costlier than
   retaining the existing ones. Business analysts and customer relationship
   management (CRM) analyzers need to know the reasons for churn customers,
   as well as, behavior patterns from the existing churn customers' data.
   This paper proposes a churn prediction model that uses classification,
   as well as, clustering techniques to identify the churn customers and
   provides the factors behind the churning of customers in the telecom
   sector. Feature selection is performed by using information gain and
   correlation attribute ranking filter. The proposed model first
   classifies churn customers data using classification algorithms, in
   which the Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed well with 88.63%
   correctly classified instances. Creating effective retention policies is
   an essential task of the CRM to prevent churners. After classification,
   the proposed model segments the churning customer's data by categorizing
   the churn customers in groups using cosine similarity to provide
   group-based retention offers. This paper also identified churn factors
   that are essential in determining the root causes of churn. By knowing
   the significant churn factors from customers' data, CRM can improve
   productivity, recommend relevant promotions to the group of likely churn
   customers based on similar behavior patterns, and excessively improve
   marketing campaigns of the company. The proposed churn prediction model
   is evaluated using metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
   f-measure, and receiving operating characteristics (ROC) area. The
   results reveal that our proposed churn prediction model produced better
   churn classification using the RF algorithm and customer profiling using
   k-means clustering. Furthermore, it also provides factors behind the
   churning of churn customers through the rules generated by using the
   attribute-selected classifier algorithm.

AB Customer Churn Prediction (CCP) is a challenging activity for decision
   makers and machine learning community because most of the time, churn
   and non-churn customers have resembling features. From different
   experiments on customer churn and related data, it can be seen that a
   classifier shows different accuracy levels for different zones of a
   dataset. In such situations, a correlation can easily be observed in the
   level of classifier's accuracy and certainty of its prediction. If a
   mechanism can be defined to estimate the classifier's certainty for
   different zones within the data, then the expected classifier's accuracy
   can be estimated even before the classification. In this paper, a novel
   CCP approach is presented based on the above concept of classifier's
   certainty estimation using distance factor. The dataset is grouped into
   different zones based on the distance factor which are then divided into
   two categories as; (i) data with high certainty, and (ii) data with low
   certainty, for predicting customers exhibiting Churn and Non-churn
   behavior. Using different state-of-the-art evaluation measures (e.g.,
   accuracy, f-measure, precision and recall) on different publicly
   available the Telecommunication Industry (TCI) datasets show that (i)
   the distance factor is strongly co-related with the certainty of the
   classifier, and (ii) the classifier obtained high accuracy in the zone
   with greater distance factor's value (i.e., customer churn and non-churn
   with high certainty) than those placed in the zone with smaller distance
   factor's value (i.e., customer chum and non-churn with low certainty).

AB Every process is digitized in the current society. Transfer of money
   from one account holder to another has become possible in seconds
   because of advanced technologies in information processing. Not only
   this in all sectors like railways, insurance, health sector, fashion
   technology, education sector, sales and business sectors, and
   advertisement sectors every firm digitized its operations. One such
   sector is banking where every individual based on his or her financial
   status will be considered for crediting loan, and credit card etc. If
   the credit score of the loan availing person is high banks will be ready
   to provide him with the loan but the availing person can opt for any one
   of the banks on his or her own willing. Such scenario happens in credit
   card churn prediction also. Hence the banks should take healthy measures
   to retain the existing credit card holders without any churn.
   Withholding existing customers of a firm plays an important role to
   increase the overall revenue of the firm and retains the good name of
   the firm in competitive market. Hence every organization takes key
   measures to withhold existing customers using customer management
   models. Because customer retention is a crucial task as it reduces the
   time, money and workforce needed for adding new customers to the firm.
   Customers retention technique in credit card churn prediction (C3P) was
   done using only supervised classification techniques. But it could not
   end with better results. So, through many proven hybrid classification
   techniques we can bring better accuracy inC3P. AlsoC3P lags in highly
   efficient techniques like rough set theory. Hence in this work initially
   we perform data processing techniques and in second stage we propose
   modified rough K-means algorithm used for clus-tering credit card
   holders and in next stage hold-out method divides the cluster data into
   testing and training clusters. At last classification is performed using
   various algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, decision
   tree, K-nearest neighbor, and Naive Bayes. Finally we evaluate the work
   using precision, recall (sensitivity), specification, accuracy, and
   misclassification error.

AB Nowadays, customers have become more interested in the quality of

   competition between organizations to maintain and increase their QoS.
   Customer Relationship Management systems are used to enable
   organizations to acquire new customers, establish a continuous
   relationship with them and increase customer retention for more
   profitability. CRM systems use machine-learning models to analyze
   customers' personal and behavioral data to give organization a
   competitive advantage by increasing customer retention rate. Those
   models can predict customers who are expected to churn and reasons of
   churn. Predictions are used to design targeted marketing plans and

   of different machine-learning techniques that are used for churn
   prediction problem. Ten analytical techniques that belong to different
   categories of learning are chosen for this study. The chosen techniques
   include Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees (CART), instance-based
   learning (k-nearest neighbors), Support Vector Machines, Logistic
   Regression, ensemble-based learning techniques (Random Forest, Ada
   Boosting trees and Stochastic Gradient Boosting), Naive Bayesian, and
   Multi-layer perceptron. Models were applied on a dataset of
   telecommunication that contains 3333 records. Results show that both
   random forest and ADA boost outperform all other techniques with almost
   the same accuracy 96%. Both Multi-layer perceptron and Support vector
   machine can be recommended as well with 94% accuracy. Decision tree
   achieved 90%, naive Bayesian 88% and finally logistic regression and

AB Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer
   churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk
   of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is
   a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify
   customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated
   whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two
   field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author
   demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of
   churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn
   programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also
   suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms
   offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right
   targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts
   on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the
   intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity
   to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach
   is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the
   standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of
   churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers
   using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect
   of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers'
   response to select customer targets.

AB Customer relationship marketing is important since it provides a long
   standing relationship between the customer and the organization. Churn
   obstructs the growth of profitable customers and it is the biggest
   challenge to sustain a telecommunication network. We propose two models
   which predicts customer churn with a high degree of accuracy. Our first
   model is a logistic regression model which is a non-linear classifier
   with signioid as its activation function. The accuracy of the model is
   heightened by regularizing it with the regularizing parameter set. to
   0.01 and this gives an accuracy of 87.52c7c, on our test dataset. Our
   second model is a full fledged Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) Neural Network
   with a normalized input feature vector which is stacked with three
   hidden layers and employs binary cross entropy as the loss function with
   a learning rate of 0.01. This model is split into a test -train set and
   achieves an accuracy of 94.19c7c. Using this predictive model the
   organization can conduct marketing research and study the needs of the
   particular customer in detail. Using that data they can produce goods
   according to the customer needs before the customer demands and present
   it to them. This helps to create brand loyalty which in turn leads to a
   sustainable network.

AB Customer Churn is a challenging and one of the most demanding issues in
   the telecom sector. The primary motivation of businesses at present is
   just not only to acquire new customers, but to retain existing customers
   as well. In fact, customer retention is more important because of the
   associated high costs. The present work has been carried out in a churn
   prediction modeling context and benchmarks four machine learning
   techniques against a publicly available telecommunication dataset. The
   results provide two important conclusions: i) Random Forest technique
   outperforms other basic classification models and ii) Feature
   Engineering plays critical role in the performance of the model.

AB Acquiring a new customer costs insurance companies several times more
   than what it costs to retain current ones, which is why reducing
   attrition (also known as churn) is so important. To retain their
   customers, insurance companies need to do three things: a) understand
   why clients churn, b) predict which clients will churn, and c) try to
   retain potential churning clients through interventions or campaigns
   that address the reasons for potential churning. However, companies
   struggle to execute these three tasks in a data-driven and integrated
   way. Therefore, we propose a data science and advanced analytics
   framework that integrates these three tasks using econometrics, machine
   learning, and A/B testing (i.e. randomized control trials). We argue
   that to take full advantage of data science, companies need to integrate
   both prediction and causation efforts. We provide a case study where we
   show how econometrics and machine learning can help design experimental
   studies to uncover causal effects (prediction enabling causation), and
   how econometric techniques can help inform and improve machine learnings
   feature engineering and selection tasks (quasi-causation improving
   prediction). We demonstrate its use and effectiveness in one of Latin
   Americas largest insurance companies. Our framework provided the
   evidence that a phone call reminding clients of the benefits of their
   policy could reduce auto insurance churn by 6 percentage points, which
   after a year will represent an additional US$750,000 in revenue.

AB Data mining is vast area that co-relates diverse branches i.e

   Various applications are accessible in various areas. Churning of the
   Customer is the behavior when client never again needs to stay with his
   association with the company. Customer Churn Management is assuming
   essential job in client management. Nowadays different telecommunication
   companies are concentrating on distinguishing high esteemed and
   potential churning clients to expand benefit and share market. It is
   comprehended that making new clients are costlier than to holding
   existing client. There is a current issue that customer leave the
   organization because of obscure reasons. In our investigation, we
   predict churn behavior of the client by utilizing diverse data mining
   methods. It will in the long run help in breaking down client's behavior
   and characterize whether it is a churning client or not. We utilize
   online accessible data set available at Kaggle repository and for
   forecasting of Customer behavior we utilized different algorithms while
   we achieved 99.8% accuracy level using Bagging Algorithms.

AB Attribute selection has a significant effect on the performance of the
   machine learning studies by selecting the attributes having significant
   effect on result, reducing the number of attributes, and reducing the
   calculation cost. In this study, a new attribute selection method which
   is a combination of the Rcorrelation coefficient-based attribute
   selection (RCBAS) and the rho-correlation coefficient-based attribute
   selection (rho CBAS) called the Two-Stage Correlation-Based Attribute
   Selection (TSCBAS) is proposed to select significant attributes. The
   proposed attribute selection method has been applied to customer churn
   prediction on a telecommunications dataset for performance evaluation.
   The dataset used in the study includes real customer call records
   details for the years 2013 and 2014 obtained from a major
   telecommunications company in Turkey. Apart from the proposed attribute
   selection method, four different methods named Rcorrelation
   coefficient-based attribute selection, rho-correlation coefficient-based
   attribute selection, ReliefF, and Gain Ratio have been used for creating
   five datasets. After that, four classifier algorithms including Random
   Forest, C4.5 Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and AdaBoost. M1 have been
   applied. The obtained results have been compared according to the
   performance metrics comprising Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (TPR),
   Specificity (SPC), F-measure (F), AUC (area under the ROC curve), and
   run-time. The results of the comparisons show that the proposed
   attribute selection algorithm outperforms the state of the art methods
   on customer churn prediction.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently among the most commonly used
   machine learning methods in content understanding such as computer
   vision and natural language understanding (NLU). One of the best
   characteristics of these methods is their modular design - the ability
   to change the connectivity patterns of layers, try different activation
   functions, inject different statistical approaches such as normalization
   and dropout in the network, and many other actions - in every aspect of
   deep learning networks. While the majority of deep learning applications
   simply use cross-entropy, L-1, and L-2 losses, subjective loss function
   can actually result in impressive performance improvement. In addition,
   architecting the last layer of DNNs - referred to as the prediction
   layer - according to the needs of the application increases the
   discriminative power of the DNNs. This paper aims to investigate how
   particular choices of loss functions and prediction layer architecture
   affect deep neural networks and their learning dynamics, as well as the
   robustness of various effects. Furthermore a real-life application to
   measure customer loyalty called Deep Net Promoter Score (DeepNPS) from
   online product reviews is also proposed. The results are promising for
   learning more latent features and matching the customer feedback with
   the NPS score.

   approach mainly focus on structured data such as demographic and
   transactional data, while unstructured data, such as emails and phone

   and behaviours from unstructured data, particularly, audio calls. To be
   specific, we developed a text mining model combined with gradient
   boosting tree to predict client churn. We collected and conducted
   extensive experiments on 900 thousand audio calls from 200 thousand
   customers, and experimental results show that our approach can
   significantly improve the previous model by exploiting the additional

AB As competition is getting fiercer between retail formats, the strategy
   to prevent shoppers from churning is very important in terms of shopper
   relationship management. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a
   predictive model to consider not only retail format choice (i.e.,
   national chains or traditional market) but also the possibility of
   cross-shopping derived from the partial churn. In order to predict
   retail format choice and degree of cross shopping, the current study
   used logistic regression analysis, decision tree, random forest, GBM,
   neural network models, which can be simultaneously used for
   classification model and regression model. In order for the degree of
   cross-shopping, the visits to the favorite retail format for each
   shopper and the visits to the alternative store format were used as
   dependent variables. The ensemble method such as random forest and
   boosting were the most superior model in predicting the retail format
   choice. Through the appropriate use of machine learning method, superior
   prediction is possible from the retail format choice for each shopper to
   the degree of the cross shopping, affecting more effective customer
   relationship management (CRM).

AB Customer churn is an essential retail metric used in business predictive
   analytics systems to quantify the number of customers who left a
   company. All retail and business to consumer companies carefully analyze
   customer behavior to prevent them to cease their relationship with the
   company, in other words to make churn. With the latest advancements of
   Artificial Intelligence and particularly related to Deep Learning, we
   have a new set of powerful tools ready to employ within multiple
   horizontal and vertical domain - such as the horizontal of predictive
   business analytics domain. One of the main goals of predictive analytics
   is the research and development of the almost-perfect churn detection
   system. This paper objective is to propose a state-of-the-art churn
   prediction model based on deep neural models, time-to-next-event models
   and employing Big Data processing on massive parallel computing using
   GPU cells.

AB Customer chum is a widely known term in many industries, including
   banking, telecommunications and gaming. By definition, churn represents
   the act of a customer leaving a product for good. Most commonly, late
   customer churn is addressed. In the dynamics of free to play games, most
   of newly registered users abandon the game in the first few days, so the
   main focus is on early customer churn. Therefore, successful early churn
   prevention methodology is vital to having a successful business in free
   to play gaming industry. To tackle this problem, we introduce a two
   stage intelligent system. It employs early churn prediction, formulated
   as a binary classification task, followed by a churn prevention
   technique using personalized push notifications. For early churn
   prediction, common machine learning models are trained and compared
   using a data set obtained from two million players of Top Eleven - Be A
   Football Manager online mobile game. To prevent churn, we track user
   activity, identify the game features that are potentially interesting to
   the user and then use that data to tailor personalized push
   notifications with a purpose to attract users back into the game. Using
   this approach, we are able to reduce churn up to 28%, which, at the
   scale of millions of users, represents a significant positive impact to
   business. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The information-based prediction models using machine learning
   techniques have gained massive popularity during the last few decades.
   Such models have been applied in a number of domains such as medical
   diagnosis, crime prediction, movies rating, etc. Similar is the trend in
   telecom industry where prediction models have been applied to predict
   the dissatisfied customers who are likely to change the service
   provider. Due to immense financial cost of customer churn in telecom,
   the companies from all over the world have analyzed various factors
   (such as call cost, call quality, customer service response time, etc.)
   using several learners such as decision trees, support vector machines,
   neural networks, probabilistic models such as Bayes, etc. This paper
   presents a detailed survey of models from 2000 to 2015 describing the
   datasets used in churn prediction, impacting features in those datasets
   and classifiers that are used to implement prediction model. A total of
   48 studies related to churn prediction in telecom industry are discussed
   using 23 datasets (3 public and 20 private). Our survey aims to
   highlight the evolution of techniques from simple features/learners to
   more complex learners and feature engineering or sampling techniques. We
   also give an overview of the current challenges in churn prediction and
   suggest solutions to resolve them. This paper will allow researchers
   such as data analysts in general and telecom operators in particular to
   choose best suited techniques and features to prepare their churn
   prediction models.

AB Companies are investing more in analytics to obtain a competitive edge
   in the market and decision makers are required better identification
   among their data to be able to interpret complex patterns more easily.
   Alluring thousands of new customers is worthless if an equal number is
   leaving. Business Intelligence (BI) systems are unable to find hidden
   churn patterns for the huge customer base. In this paper, a decision
   support system has been proposed, which can predict the churning
   behaviour of a customer efficiently. We have proposed a procedure to
   develop an analytical system using data mining as well as machine
   learning techniques C5, CHAID, QUEST, and ANN for the churn analysis and
   prediction for the telecommunication industry. Prediction performance
   can be significantly improved by using a large volume and several
   features from both Business Support Systems (BSS) and Operations Support
   Systems (OSS). Extensive experiments are performed; marginal increases
   in predictive performance can be seen by using a larger volume and
   multiple attributes from both Telco BSS and OSS data. From the results,
   it is observed that using a combination of techniques can help to figure
   out a better and precise churn prediction model.

AB Customer churn prediction has gathered greater interest in business
   especially in telecommunications industries. Many authors have presented
   different versions of the churn prediction models greatly based on the
   data mining concepts employing the machine learning and meta-heuristic
   algorithms. This aim of this paper is to study some of the most
   important churn prediction techniques developed over the recent years.
   The primary objective is on the churn in telecom industries to
   accurately estimate the customer survival and customer hazard functions
   to gain the complete knowledge of churn over the customer tenure.
   Another objective is the identification of the customers who are at the
   blink of churn and approximating the time they will churn. This paper
   focuses on analyzing the churn prediction techniques to identify the
   churn behavior and validate the reasons for customer churn. This paper
   summarizes the churn prediction techniques in order to have a deeper
   understanding of the customer churn and it shows that most accurate
   churn prediction is given by the hybrid models rather than single
   algorithms so that telecom industries become aware of the needs of high
   risk customers and enhance their services to overturn the churn
   decision.

   industry, it is mandatory to understand the need of customers who might
   think to move toward another competitor. Thus, assessing the churn
   prediction, which becomes a real concern in the telecom industry, is
   critical in predicting future trends of the industry. In this work, we
   wanted to determine the best and reliable prediction model in improving
   the competitiveness of Moroccan telecommunication sector. We focused on
   prepaid costumers, a group of subscribers that are unreliable, less
   committed to a provider, and they can end their services without prior
   notices. We used various machine learning techniques applied to Call
   Details Records (CDR) to analyze a dataset of 635997 subscribers and
   monitored their usage behaviors over a period of three months. The
   Visitor Location Register ID, which describes the locations where
   calls/SMS/Recharge and Data events were performed was also used to
   investigate the churning rate per different regions. Among models
   tested, we found that the Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is the best
   classifier model with accuracy of 91% and f1 score of 89%. This model
   fits better the Churn prediction use case.

   predict the QoE experienced by the end user of popular smartphone apps
   YouTube and Facebook), using as input the passive in-device
   measurements. Using a rich QoE dataset derived from field trials in

   machine learning based predictors, and construct a decision-tree based
   model which is capable to predict the per-user overall experience and
   service acceptability with a success rate of 91% and 98% respectively.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper using end-user,

   face loss of revenue when customer switch to competitor. For retaining
   the customer, an exact or accurate customer churn prediction model is
   required to estimate the number of customer who will churn out of
   current service provider which will be referred as churners. With the
   significant boom in machine learning research in recent years and having
   both power and high dimensional data, machine learning techniques can be
   used to predict those churners. This paper provides information on
   challenges and way of building the churn prediction model. This also
   provides a roadmap for the researchers to tackle supervised learning

AB Despite the massive adoption of HTTP adaptive streaming technology,
   buffering is still the most harmful event for QoE in video streaming.
   Previous studies have shown that buffering is not only detrimental for
   the overall user experience, but is also highly correlated to viewer
   engagement. The occurrence of buffering is particularly critical in
   cellular networks and mobile video deployments, as network conditions
   are less stable and network resources more limited. In this context,
   monitoring and properly predicting the QoE of video streaming services
   becomes paramount to cellular network operators, who need to offer high
   quality levels to reduce the risks of customers churning for quality
   dissatisfaction. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
   multi-dimensional QoE prediction in mobile video using machine learning
   models. Contrary to previous models for QoE prediction in video
   streaming, which are generally uni- or low-dimensional and model the
   impact of single video descriptors independently, we use a
   high-dimensional input space to model the impact of buffering and
   initial delay on QoE. We train and test the proposed models on a
   publicly available mobile video dataset, generated from subjective QoE
   tests with real viewers. Besides improving prediction performance, the
   proposed models show that there is a clear influence of other buffering
   pattern descriptors generally neglected in previous models - in
   particular those linked to the occurrence of the last stalling event,
   shedding light on new KPIs to monitor for better QoE assessment in video
   streaming.

   translate this research onto their own datasets and IT infrastructure.
   In this paper we present a series of experiments that aim to predict
   customer behaviour, in order to increase gym utilisation and customer
   retention. We use two off-the-shelf machine learning platforms, so that
   we can evaluate whether these platforms, used by non ML experts, can
   help companies improve their services.

AB Customer retention in telecommunication is one of the prime issue in
   customer relationship management (CRM). The primary focus of CRM is on
   existing customer as it is difficult to acquire new customers. The main
   goal of churn prediction is to classify customers into churner &
   non-churner. Towards this, deep learning as they are equipped with large
   increasing data sizes and uncover hidden pattern insights, detects
   pattern, underlying risks and alert the Telecom Industry about customer
   behaviour with a better accuracy as compared to the traditional machine
   learning methods. In this paper, Deep learning by Convolutional Neural
   Network (CNN) is implemented for churn prediction and it showed good
   performance in terms of accuracy. The experimental results shows that
   the predictive model for churn prediction out performs with an accuracy
   of 86.85%, error rate of 13.15%, precision 91.08, recall 93.08%, F-score
   92.06%

AB Recently, AlphaGo which is Bakuk (Go) artificial intelligence program by
   Google DeepMind, had a huge victory against Lee Sedol. Many people
   thought that machines would not be able to win a man in Go games because
   the number of paths to make a one move is more than the number of atoms
   in the universe unlike chess, but the result was the opposite to what
   people predicted. After the match, artificial intelligence technology
   was focused as a core technology of the fourth industrial revolution and
   attracted attentions from various application domains. Especially, deep
   learning technique have been attracted as a core artificial intelligence
   technology used in the AlphaGo algorithm.The deep learning technique is
   already being applied to many problems. Especially, it shows good
   performance in image recognition field. In addition, it shows good
   performance in high dimensional data area such as voice, image and
   natural language, which was difficult to get good performance using
   existing machine learning techniques. However, in contrast, it is
   difficult to find deep leaning researches on traditional business data
   and structured data analysis. In this study, we tried to find out
   whether the deep learning techniques have been studied so far can be
   used not only for the recognition of high dimensional data but also for
   the binary classification problem of traditional business data analysis
   such as customer churn analysis, marketing response prediction, and
   default prediction. And we compare the performance of the deep learning
   techniques with that of traditional artificial neural network models.The
   experimental data in the paper is the telemarketing response data of a
   bank in Portugal. It has input variables such as age, occupation, loan
   status, and the number of previous telemarketing and has a binary target
   variable that records whether the customer intends to open an account or
   not. In this study, to evaluate the possibility of utilization of deep
   learning algorithms and techniques in binary classification problem, we
   compared the performance of various models using CNN, LSTM algorithm and
   dropout, which are widely used algorithms and techniques in deep
   learning, with that of MLP models which is a traditional artificial
   neural network model. However, since all the network design alternatives
   can not be tested due to the nature of the artificial neural network,
   the experiment was conducted based on restricted settings on the number
   of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the number
   of output data (filters), and the application conditions of the dropout
   technique. The F1 Score was used to evaluate the performance of models
   to show how well the models work to classify the interesting class
   instead of the overall accuracy.The detail methods for applying each
   deep learning technique in the experiment is as follows. The CNN
   algorithm is a method that reads adjacent values from a specific value
   and recognizes the features, but it does not matter how close the
   distance of each business data field is because each field is usually
   independent. In this experiment, we set the filter size of the CNN
   algorithm as the number of fields to learn the whole characteristics of
   the data at once, and added a hidden layer to make decision based on the
   additional features. For the model having two LSTM layers, the input
   direction of the second layer is put in reversed position with first
   layer in order to reduce the influence from the position of each
   field.In the case of the dropout technique, we set the neurons to
   disappear with a probability of 0.5 for each hidden layer.The
   experimental results show that the predicted model with the highest F1
   score was the CNN model using the dropout technique, and the next best
   model was the MLP model with two hidden layers using the dropout
   technique. In this study, we were able to get some findings as the
   experiment had proceeded. First, models using dropout techniques have a
   slightly more conservative prediction than those without dropout
   techniques, and it generally shows better performance in classification.
   Second, CNN models show better classification performance than MLP
   models. This is interesting because it has shown good performance in
   binary classification problems which it rarely have been applied to, as
   well as in the fields where it’s effectiveness has been proven. Third,
   the LSTM algorithm seems to be unsuitable for binary classification
   problems because the training time is too long compared to the
   performance improvement. From these results, we can confirm that some of
   the deep learning algorithms can be applied to solve business binary
   classification problems.
AK 최근 알파고의 등장으로 딥러닝 기술에 대한 관심이 고조되고 있다. 딥러닝은 향후 미래의 핵심 기술이 되어일상생활의 많은 부분을
   개선할 것이라는 기대를 받고 있지만, 주요한 성과들이 이미지 인식과 자연어처리 등에 국한되어 있고 전통적인 비즈니스 애널리틱스
   문제에의 활용은 미비한 실정이다. 실제로 딥러닝 기술은Convolutional Neural Network(CNN),
   Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) 등 알고리즘들의 선택,
   Dropout 기법의 활용여부, 활성 함수의 선정 등 다양한 네트워크 설계 이슈들을 가지고 있다. 따라서 비즈니스 문제에서의
   딥러닝 알고리즘 활용은 아직 탐구가 필요한 영역으로 남아있으며, 특히 딥러닝을현실에 적용했을 때 발생할 수 있는 여러 가지
   문제들은 미지수이다.이에 따라 본 연구에서는 다이렉트 마케팅 응답모델, 고객이탈분석, 대출 위험 분석 등의 주요한 분류 문제인
   이진분류에 딥러닝을 적용할 수 있을 것인지 그 가능성을 실험을 통해 확인하였다. 실험에는 어느 포르투갈은행의 텔레마케팅 응답여부에
   대한 데이터 집합을 사용하였으며, 전통적인 인공신경망인 Multi-Layer Perceptron, 딥러닝 알고리즘인 CNN과
   RNN을 변형한 Long Short-Term Memory, 딥러닝 모형에 많이 활용되는Dropout 기법 등을 이진 분류 문제에
   활용했을 때의 성능을 비교하였다.실험을 수행한 결과 CNN 알고리즘은 비즈니스 데이터의 이진분류 문제에서도 MLP 모형에 비해
   향상된 성능을 보였다. 또한 MLP와 CNN 모두 Dropout을 적용한 모형이 적용하지 않은 모형보다 더 좋은 분류
   성능을보여줌에 따라, Dropout을 적용한 CNN 알고리즘이 이진분류 문제에도 활용될 수 있는 가능성을 확인하였다.

AB The recent big data hype has emphasized data analysis as one of the main
   sources of knowledge generation. Of course, the idea of data as a
   fundamental element for the existence of knowledge is not new. But the
   possibility of acquiring and analyzing large amounts of data from varied
   sources at high speed (the so-called 3 V's of big data) has become
   possible only lately in many areas. Therefore, many companies are
   starting to rely on machine learning algorithms applied to huge
   databases to know more about their customers, their competitors, or
   their environment. In other fields, though, this trend is not new at
   all. In many fields of science like high energy physics, genomics or
   astrophysics big data have been there for a long time. For instance, the
   famous High Energy Physics experiments that have taken place at CERN in
   the last decades would have been impossible without the capacity to
   gather, combine and analyze the large streams of data churned out by
   their huge particle detectors. Similar cases are those of the Human
   Genome Project or the large telescopes. In this paper we will examine
   how the process of extracting knowledge from data is performed in one of
   the most complex experiments ever: the ATLAS experiment. ATLAS is one of
   the main experiments of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where the
   Higgs' boson was detected. Relying on a knowledge management approach,
   our research combines archival research on the ATLAS experiment
   documentation with in-depth interviews with several physicists and
   engineers conducted at CERN in the last years. We look at different
   aspects of the generation of scientific knowledge from data like the
   research data management, data infrastructures, collaboration in data
   analysis, the role of simulations or the validity of scientific
   knowledge derived from data. We also examine the ATLAS policy on
   research data management and their bet for open science through CERN's
   Open Data Portal. Some of the insights we extract from this research can
   be useful not only to other fields of scientific research now getting
   into big data like some areas of social science (i.e., computational
   social science) but also to companies and institutions testing the
   waters of the big data business

AB Debt collection via call centers is an important operation in many
   business domains since it can significantly improve a firm's financial
   status by turning bad receivables into normal cash income that
   contributes to profits. Since the job performance of call center agents
   who carry out debt collection is primarily evaluated by the amount of
   debt collected, call center managers are faced with the challenge of
   allocating customer contact lists in a fair manner to eliminate a
   non-controllable external factor that could distort the objective
   evaluation of the agent's job performance. In this paper, we develop
   five machine learning-based late payment prediction models and ten
   customer scoring rules to predict the payment likelihood and the amount
   of the late payment for the customers who currently have an unpaid debt.
   The proposed scoring rules are verified under ten different contexts by
   varying the number of agents. Experimental results confirm that the
   prediction model-based scoring rules lead to fairer customer allocation
   results among the agents compared to the existing heuristic-based
   customer scoring rules. Among the prediction models, a hybrid approach
   can capture the late payers effectively, whereas tree-based models
   report more impartial customer allocation than the other methods. (C)

AB When and why people change their mobile phones are important issues in
   mobile communications industry, because it will impact greatly on the
   marketing strategy and revenue estimation for both mobile operators and
   manufactures. It is a promising way to take use of big data to analyze
   and predict the phone changing event. In this paper, based on mobile
   user big data, first through statistical analysis, we find that three
   important probability distributions, i.e., power-law, log-normal, and
   geometric distribution, play an important role in the user behaviors.
   Second, the relationships between eight selected attributes and phone
   changing are built, for example, young people have greater intention to
   change their phones if they are using the phones belonging to the low
   occupancy phones or feature phones. Third, we verified the performance
   of four prediction models on phone changing event under three scenarios.
   Information gain ratio was used to implement attribute selection and
   then sampling method, cost-sensitive together with standard classifiers
   were used to solve imbalanced phone changing event. Experiment results
   show our proposed enhanced backpropagation neural network in the
   undersampling scenario can attain better prediction performance.

AB In this competitive world, business is becoming highly saturated.
   Especially, the field of telecommunication faces complex challenges due
   to a number of vibrant competitive service providers. Therefore, it has
   become very difficult for them to retain existing customers. Since the
   cost of acquiring new customers is much higher than the cost of
   retaining the existing customers, it is the time for the telecom
   industries to take necessary steps to retain the customers to stabilize
   their market value. This paper explores the application of data mining
   techniques in predicting the likely churners and attribute selection on
   identifying the churn. It also compares the efficiency of several
   classifiers and lists their performances for two real telecom datasets.

AB Curse of dimensionality will occur if effective dimensionality reduction
   method is not applied in machine learning, especially in the telecom
   field. The existing researches on customer churn are still lack of a set
   of scientific, system theory and method and the single models methods
   for customer churn prediction also are unable to completely meet
   application needs. Therefore, it is important for theoretical and
   practical contribution to explore and study the customer churn
   prediction. Based on the substantive characteristics of customer churn
   in telecommunication, the indicator system of customer churn in
   telecommunication are studied in this paper. Firstly, we proposed a
   feature selection method based on pruning technique, which is called
   feature selection method based on orientation ordering pruning Method
   (OOPM). According to this algorithm attribute selection problem can be
   replaced by the pruning question of classifier combination and we
   structure an indicator system of customer churn. Secondly, in order to
   explore high-order statistical information in the properties, a feature
   extraction method based on Random Forest and Transduction (FE_RF&T) is
   proposed to extract multiple features from customer data. Experiments on
   the real data of telecom enterprise show that the feature selection
   method based on OOPM has more advantages than the feature selection
   method based on Random Forest, and compared to the PCA method the
   FE_RF&T method improves the performance of learning machine effectively.

   The model is applied to the case of customer churning in a

AB Recently, due to the global competition companies active in different
   industries started to be concerned about the customer churn. With a
   churn rate of 30%, the telecommunications sector takes the first place
   on the list. The telecommunications operators need to identify customers
   who are at risk of churning by implementing predictive models. In this
   paper, we present an advanced data mining methodology which predicts
   customer churn in the pre-paid mobile telecommunications industry using
   a call details records dataset that consists of 3333 customers with 21
   attributes each. We first apply the principal component analysis
   algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the data and eliminate the
   problem of multicollinearity. To implement the predictive models, on the
   resulted principal components and discrete variables we initially
   propose and then apply three machine learning algorithms: neural
   networks, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks. To evaluate
   the models, we use the confusion matrix, the gain measure and the ROC
   curve.

AB Customer churn prediction in Telecom industry is one of the most
   prominent research topics in recent years. It consists of detecting
   customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service.
   Recently, the mobile telecommunication market has changed from a rapidly
   growing market into a state of saturation and fierce competition. The
   focus of telecommunication companies has therefore shifted from building
   a large customer base into keeping customers in house. For that reason,
   it is valuable to know which customers are likely to switch to a
   competitor in the near future. The data extracted from telecom industry
   can help analyze the reasons of customer churn and use that information
   to retain the customers. We have proposed to build a model for churn
   prediction for telecommunication companies using data mining and machine
   learning techniques namely logistic regression and decision trees. A
   comparison is made based on efficiency of these algorithms on the
   available dataset.

   especially customer churn. Predictive models have long been used to
   address this issue in these markets, where companies have a considerable
   amount of demographic, economic, and behavioral data about their
   customers, while online game publishers often only have behavioral data.
   Simple time series' feature representation schemes like RFM can provide
   reasonable predictive models solely based on online game players' login
   records, but maybe without fully exploring the predictive potential of
   these data. We propose a frequency analysis approach for feature
   representation from login records for churn prediction modeling. These
   entries (from real data) were converted into fixed-length data arrays
   using four different methods, and then these were used as input for
   training probabilistic classifiers with the k-nearest neighbors machine
   learning algorithm. The classifiers were then evaluated and compared
   using predictive performance metrics. One of the methods, the
   time-frequency plane domain analysis, showed satisfactory results, being
   able to theoretically increase the retention campaigns profits in more
   than 20% over the RFM approach.

AB We present a comparative study on the most popular machine learning
   methods applied to the challenging problem of customer churning
   prediction in the telecommunications industry. In the first phase of our
   experiments, all models were applied and evaluated using
   cross-validation on a popular, public domain dataset. In the second
   phase, the performance improvement offered by boosting was studied. In
   order to determine the most efficient parameter combinations we
   performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations for each method and for a
   wide range of parameters. Our results demonstrate clear superiority of
   the boosted versions of the models against the plain (non-boosted)
   versions. The best overall classifier was the SVM-POLY using AdaBoost
   with accuracy of almost 97% and F-measure over 84%. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Churn prediction, or the task of identifying customers who are likely to
   discontinue use of a service, is an important and lucrative concern of
   firms in many different industries. As these firms collect an increasing
   amount of large-scale, heterogeneous data on the characteristics and
   behaviors of customers, new methods become possible for predicting
   churn. In this paper, we present a unified analytic framework for
   detecting the early warning signs of churn, and assigning a " Churn
   Score" to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the
   particular individual will churn within a predefined amount of time.
   This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering,
   then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection,
   before feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning
   algorithms. Using several terabytes of data from a large mobile phone
   network, our method identifies several intuitive and a few
   surprising-early warning signs of churn, and our best model predicts
   whether a subscriber will churn with 89.4% accuracy.

AB Response modeling is a well-known research issue for those who have
   tried to get more superior performance in the capability of predicting
   the customers’ response for the marketing promotion. The response model
   for customers would reduce the marketing cost by identifying prospective
   customers from very large customer database and predicting the
   purchasing intention of the selected customers while the promotion which
   is derived from an undifferentiated marketing strategy results in
   unnecessary cost. In addition, the big data environment has accelerated
   developing the response model with data mining techniques such as CBR,
   neural networks and support vector machines. And CBR is one of the most
   major tools in business because it is known as simple and robust to
   apply to the response model. However, CBR is an attractive data mining
   technique for data mining applications in business even though it hasn’t
   shown high performance compared to other machine learning techniques.
   Thus many studies have tried to improve CBR and utilized in business
   data mining with the enhanced algorithms or the support of other
   techniques such as genetic algorithm, decision tree and AHP (Analytic
   Process Hierarchy). Ahn and Kim(2008) utilized logit, neural networks,
   CBR to predict that which customers would purchase the items promoted by
   marketing department and tried to optimized the number of k for
   k-nearest neighbor with genetic algorithm for the purpose of improving
   the performance of the integrated model. Hong and Park(2009) noted that
   the integrated approach with CBR for logit, neural networks, and Support
   Vector Machine (SVM) showed more improved prediction ability for
   response of customers to marketing promotion than each data mining
   models such as logit, neural networks, and SVM.This paper presented an
   approach to predict customers’ response of marketing promotion with Case
   Based Reasoning. The proposed model was developed by applying different
   weights to each feature. We deployed logit model with a database
   including the promotion and the purchasing data of bath soap. After
   that, the coefficients were used to give different weights of CBR. We
   analyzed the performance of proposed weighted CBR based model compared
   to neural networks and pure CBR based model empirically and found that
   the proposed weighted CBR based model showed more superior performance
   than pure CBR model.Imbalanced data is a common problem to build data
   mining model to classify a class with real data such as bankruptcy
   prediction, intrusion detection, fraud detection, churn management, and
   response modeling. Imbalanced data means that the number of instance in
   one class is remarkably small or large compared to the number of
   instance in other classes. The classification model such as response
   modeling has a lot of trouble to recognize the pattern from data through
   learning because the model tends to ignore a small number of classes
   while classifying a large number of classes correctly. To resolve the
   problem caused from imbalanced data distribution, sampling method is one
   of the most representative approach. The sampling method could be
   categorized to under sampling and over sampling. However, CBR is not
   sensitive to data distribution because it doesn’t learn from data unlike
   machine learning algorithm. In this study, we investigated the
   robustness of our proposed model while changing the ratio of response
   customers and nonresponse customers to the promotion program because the
   response customers for the suggested promotion is always a small part of
   nonresponse customers in the real world. We simulated the proposed model
   100 times to validate the robustness with different ratio of response
   customers to response customers under the imbalanced data distribution.
   Finally, we found that our proposed CBR based model showed superior
   performance than compared models under the imbalanced data sets. Our
   study is expected to improve the performance of response model for the
   promotion program with CBR under imbalanced data distribution in the
   real world.

AB While dealing with BigData and with data streams in particular, it is a
   common practice to summarize or aggregate customers' transaction history
   to the periods of few months. Consequently, we shall compress the given
   huge volume of data, and shall transfer the data stream to the standard
   rectangular format, where columns represent secondary aggregated
   features and rows represent customers. This data-matrix is suitable as
   an input to many classification or regression machine learning models.
   Using those models, we can explore a variety of practically or
   theoretically motivated tasks. For example, we can rank the given field
   of customers in accordance to their loyalty or intension to repurchase
   in the near future. This objective has very important practical
   application. It leads to preferential treatment of the right customers.
   It also reduces the likelihood of bombarding customers, who are less
   likely to purchase, with marketing material over email or postal mail.

AB In all customer based industries, customer churn is considered as one of
   the most important and challenging concerns since it can lead to a
   serious profit loss. Therefore, developing accurate churn prediction
   models can significantly help Customer Relationship Management in
   planning effective retention campaigns and consequently helps in
   maximizing the profit of the service provider. In this paper, we propose
   the use of an Echo State Network (ESN) with a Support Vector Machine
   (SVM) training algorithm for predicting customer churn in
   telecommunication companies. The proposed approach is trained and tested
   based on two datasets: the first is a popular online available dataset
   while the second is obtained from a local service provider. Experiment
   results show that ESN with SVM readout outperform other popular machine
   learning models used in the literature for the same customer churn
   prediction problems.

AB Support vector machine (SVM) is currently state-of-the-art for
   classification tasks due to its ability to model nonlinearities.
   However, the main drawback of SVM is that it generates "black box"
   model, i.e. it does not reveal the knowledge learnt during training in
   human comprehensible form. The process of converting such opaque models
   into a transparent model is often regarded as rule extraction. In this
   paper we proposed a hybrid approach for extracting rules from SVM for
   customer relationship management (CRM) purposes. The proposed hybrid
   approach consists of three phases. (i) During first phase; SVM-RFE
   (SVM-recursive feature elimination) is employed to reduce the feature
   set. (ii) Dataset with reduced features is then used in the second phase
   to obtain SVM model and support vectors are extracted. (iii) Rules are
   then generated using Naive Bayes Tree (NBTree) in the final phase. The
   dataset analyzed in this research study is about Churn prediction in
   bank credit card customer (Business Intelligence Cup 2004) and it is
   highly unbalanced with 93.24% loyal and 6.76% churned customers. Further
   we employed various standard balancing approaches to balance the data
   and extracted rules. It is observed from the empirical results that the
   proposed hybrid outperformed all other techniques tested. As the reduced
   feature dataset is used, it is also observed that the proposed approach
   extracts smaller length rules, thereby improving the comprehensibility
   of the system. The generated rules act as an early warning expert system
   to the bank management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   condition (i.e., whether the customer is defecting from the company or
   merely stopped using a current product to up/downgrade it) and to
   produce a measure of customer loyalty by compiling the number of
   customers' purchases and renewals. Based on the results, we investigated
   important variables for classifying defecting customers using a random
   forest and built a prediction model using a decision tree. The final
   results indicate that defecting customers are mainly characterized by
   their loyalty and their number of total payments.

AB The activities for customer relationship retention are most essential
   process of customer relationship management. If we improve the rate of
   churn customers about 5%, it is known that the profit rate of the
   company raises about 100%. Prediction activities must be preceded for
   management of the churn customers. If we can predict churn customers in
   advance, we can minimize the loss because of removing the churn factor.
   Data sets about churn customers have an imbalanced characteristic that
   the number of the churn customers is less remarkably than the number of
   the retention customers. One of the main issues on the models to predict
   churn customers is to increase prediction performance. This research
   deals with decision tree, neural networks, and SVM models those are
   mainly used to predict the churn customers and known as good prediction
   performance, and proposes a hybrid weighted data mining classifier. To
   test the prediction performance of proposed method, this study used
   'churn data sets' in UCI Machine Learning Repository. Experimental
   results showed that the method was effective for prediction of churn
   customers.

AB Churning is the movement of customers from a company to another. For any
   company, being able to predict with some time which of their customers
   will churn is essential to take actions in order to retain them, and for
   this reason most sectors invest substantial effort in techniques for
   (semi) automatically predicting churning, and data mining and machine
   learning are among the techniques successfully used to this effect. In
   this paper we describe a prototype for churn prediction using stream
   mining methods, which offer the additional promise of detecting new
   patterns of churn in real-time streams of high-speed data, and adapting
   quickly to a changing reality. The prototype is implemented on top of
   the MOA (Massive Online Analysis) framework for stream mining. The
   application implicit in the prototype is the telecommunication operator
   (mobile phone) sector.

AB During the last two decades, we have seen mobile communication becoming
   the dominant medium of communication. In numerous countries, especially
   the developed ones, the market is saturated to the extent that each new
   customer must be won over from the competitors. At the same time, public
   policies and standardization of mobile communication now allow customers
   to easily switch over from one carrier to another, resulting in a fluid
   market. Since the cost of winning a new customer is far greater than the
   cost of retaining an existing one, mobile carriers have now shifted
   their focus from customer acquisition to customer retention. As a
   result, churn prediction has emerged as the most crucial Business
   Intelligence (BI) application that aims at identifying customers who are
   about to transfer their business to a competitor i.e. to churn. This
   paper aims to present commonly used data mining techniques for the
   identification of customers who are about to churn. Based on historical
   data, these methods try to find patterns which can identify possible
   churners. Some of the well-known algorithms used during this research
   are Regression analysis, Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs). The data set used in this study was obtained from Customer DNA
   website. It contains traffic data of 106,000 customers and their usage
   behavior for 3 months. We also discuss the use of re-sampling method in
   order to solve the problem of class imbalance. Our results show that in
   case of the data set used, decision trees is the most accurate
   classifier algorithm while identifying potential churners.

AB Subscriber churn is a concern of customer care management for most of
   the mobile and wireless service providers and operators due to its
   associated costs. This paper explains our work on subscriber churn
   analysis and prediction for such services. We work on data mining
   techniques to accurately and efficiently predict subscribers who will
   change-and-turn (churn) to another provider for the same or similar
   service. The dataset we use is a public and real dataset compiled by
   Orange Telecom for the KDD 2009 Competition. Number of teams achieved
   high scores on this dataset requiring a significant amount of computing
   resources. We are aiming to find alternative methods that can match or
   improve the recorded high scores with more efficient and practical use
   of resources. In this study, we focus on ensemble of meta-classifiers
   which have been studied individually and chosen according to their
   performances.

AB We call a data set in which the number of records belonging to a certain
   class far outnumbers the number of records belonging to the other class,
   ‘imbalanced data set’. Most of the classification techniques perform
   poorly on imbalanced data sets. When we evaluate the performance of a
   certain classification technique, we need to measure not only ‘accuracy’
   but also ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity'. In a customer churn prediction
   problem, ‘retention’ records account for the majority class, and ‘churn’
   records account for the minority class. Sensitivity measures the
   proportion of actual retentions which are correctly identified as such.
   Specificity measures the proportion of churns which are correctly
   identified as such. The poor performance of the classification
   techniques on imbalanced data sets is due to the low value of
   specificity.Many previous researches on imbalanced data sets employed
   ‘oversampling’ technique where members of the minority class are sampled
   more than those of the majority class in order to make a relatively
   balanced data set. When a classification model is constructed using this
   oversampled balanced data set, specificity can be improved but
   sensitivity will be decreased.In this research, we developed a hybrid
   model of support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN)
   and decision tree, that improves specificity while maintaining
   sensitivity. We named this hybrid model ‘hybrid SVM model.’ The process
   of construction and prediction of our hybrid SVM model is as follows.By
   oversampling from the original imbalanced data set, a balanced data set
   is prepared. SVM_I model and ANN_I model are constructed using the
   imbalanced data set, and SVM_B model is constructed using the balanced
   data set. SVM_I model is superior in sensitivity and SVM_B model is
   superior in specificity. For a record on which both SVM_I model and
   SVM_B model make the same prediction, that prediction becomes the final
   solution. If they make different prediction, the final solution is
   determined by the discrimination rules obtained by ANN and decision
   tree. For a record on which SVM_I model and SVM_B model make different
   predictions, a decision tree model is constructed using ANN_I output
   value as input and actual retention or churn as target. We obtained the
   following two discrimination rules: ‘IF ANN_I output value <0.285, THEN
   Final Solution = Retention’ and ‘IF ANN_I output value â‰¥0.285, THEN
   Final Solution = Churn.’ The threshold 0.285 is the value optimized for
   the data used in this research. The result we present in this research
   is the structure or framework of our hybrid SVM model, not a specific
   threshold value such as 0.285. Therefore, the threshold value in the
   above discrimination rules can be changed to any value depending on the
   data.In order to evaluate the performance of our hybrid SVM model, we
   used the ‘churn data set’ in UCI Machine Learning Repository, that
   consists of 85% retention customers and 15% churn customers. Accuracy of
   the hybrid SVM model is 91.08% that is better than that of SVM_I model
   or SVM_B model. The points worth noticing here are its sensitivity,
   95.02%, and specificity, 69.24%. The sensitivity of SVM_I model is
   94.65%, and the specificity of SVM_B model is 67.00%. Therefore the
   hybrid SVM model developed in this research improves the specificity of
   SVM_B model while maintaining the sensitivity of SVM_I model.
AK 어떤 클래스에 속한 레코드의 개수가 다른 클래스들에 속한 레코드의 개수보다 매우 많은 경우에, 이 데이터 집합을 ‘불균형 데이터
   집합’이라고 한다. 데이터 분류에 사용되는 많은 기법들은 이러한 불균형 데이터에 대해서 저조한 성능을 보인다. 어떤 기법의 성능을
   평가할 때에 적중률뿐만 아니라, 민감도와 특이도도 함께 측정하여야 한다. 고객의 이탈을 예측하는 문제에서 ‘유지’ 레코드가 다수
   클래스를 차지하고, ‘이탈’ 레코드는 소수 클래스를 차지한다. 민감도는 실제로 ‘유지’인 레코드를 ‘유지’로 예측하는 비율이고,
   특이도는 실제로 ‘이탈’인 레코드를 ‘이탈’로 예측하는 비율이다. 많은 데이터 마이닝 기법들이 불균형 데이터에 대해서 저조한
   성능을 보이는 것은 바로 소수 클래스의 적중률인 특이도가 낮기 때문이다.불균형 데이터 집합에 대처하는 과거 연구 중에는 소수
   클래스를 Oversampling하여 균형 데이터 집합을 생성한 후에 데이터 마이닝 기법을 적용한 연구들이 있다. 이렇게 균형
   데이터 집합을 생성하여 예측을 수행하면, 특이도는 다소 향상시킬 수 있으나 그 대신 민감도가 하락하게 된다. 본 연구에서는
   민감도는 유지하면서 특이도를 향상시키는 모델을 개발하였다. 개발된 모델은 Support Vector Machine (SVM),
   인공신경망(ANN) 그리고 의사결정나무 기법 등으로 구성된 하이브리드 모델로서, Hybrid SVM Model이라고 명명하였다.
   구축과정 및 예측과정은 다음과 같다.원래의 불균형 데이터 집합으로 SVM_I Model과 ANN_I Model을 구축한다. 불균형
   데이터 집합으로부터 Oversampling을 하여 균형 데이터 집합을 생성하고, 이것으로 SVM_B Model을 구축한다.
   SVM_I Model은 민감도에서 우수하고, SVM_B Model은 특이도에서 우수하다. 입력 레코드에 대해서 SVM_I와
   SVM_B가 동일한 예측치를 도출하면 그것을 최종 해로 결정한다. SVM_I와 SVM_B가 상이한 예측치를 도출한 레코드에
   대해서는 ANN과 의사결정나무의 도움으로 판별 과정을 거쳐서 최종 해를 결정한다. 상이한 예측치를 도출한 레코드에 대해서는,
   ANN_I의 출력값을 입력속성으로, 실제 이탈 여부를 목표 속성으로 설정하여 의사결정나무 모델을 구축한다. 그 결과 다음과 같은
   2개의 판별규칙을 얻었다. ‘IF ANN_I output value < 0.285, THEN Final Solution =
   Retention' 그리고 ‘IF ANN_I output value â‰¥0.285, THEN Final Solution =
   Churn'이다. 제시되어 있는 규칙의 Threshold 값인 0.285는 본 연구에서 사용한 데이터에 최적화되어 도출된 값이다.
   본 연구에서 제시하는 것은 Hybrid SVM Model의 구조이지 특정한 Threshold 값이 아니기 때문에 이
   Threshold 값은 대상 데이터에 따라서 얼마든지 변할 수 있다.Hybrid SVM Model의 성능을 UCI Machine
   Learning Repository에서 제공하는 Churn 데이터 집합을 사용하여 평가하였다. Hybrid SVM Model의
   적중률은 91.08%로서 SVM_I Model이나 SVM_B Model의 적중률보다 높았다. Hybrid SVM Model의
   민감도는 95.02%이었고, 특이도는 69.24%이었다. SVM_I Model의 민감도는 94.65%이었고, SVM_B
   Model의 특이도는 67.00%이었다. 그러므로 본 연구에서 개발한 Hybrid SVM Model이 SVM_I Model의
   민감도 수준은 유지하면서 SVM_B Model의 특이도보다는 향상된 성능을 보였다.

AB Customer classification is an imperative task for any organization
   catering to different market segments. In telecom industry it becomes
   even more important to identify which value added services(VAS) would be
   successful with a given customer segment. VAS provide a flexible revenue
   model that can be customized to different customer segments based on
   several attributes such as usage and preferences. Selecting and
   customizing VAS provides a wide canvas to the operators for maximizing
   their returns on the customer portfolio. Computational intelligence
   techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) have been successfully used for data mining and machine
   learning. These techniques provide a mathematical framework for
   identifying customers profiles and patterns in large datasets that
   representing the customers' data and their preferences. In this paper,
   we propose a methodology using SVM and ANN techniques to classify
   telecom customer data and identify the VAS best suited for the customer
   segment. We test our results with the SVM yielding high prediction
   accuracy for the unknown public test data with Radial Basis
   Function(RBF) Kernel using grid search technique.

AB Preventing customer churn is an important task for many enterprises and
   requires customer churn prediction. This paper investigates the effects
   of interpersonal influence on the accuracy of customer churn predictions
   and proposes a novel prediction model that is based on interpersonal
   influence and that combines the propagation process and customers'
   personalized characters. Our contributions include the following: (1)
   the effects of interpersonal influence on prediction accuracy are
   evaluated while including determinants that other researchers proved
   effective, and several models are constructed based on machine learning
   and statistical methods and compared, assuring the validity of the
   evaluation: and (2) a novel prediction model based on interpersonal
   influence and information propagation is proposed. The dataset used in
   the empirical study was obtained from a leading mobile telecommunication
   service provider and contains the traditional and network attributes of
   over one million customers. The empirical results show that traditional
   classification models that incorporate interpersonal influence can
   greatly improve prediction accuracy, and our proposed prediction model
   outperforms the traditional models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Customer churn is a notorious problem for most industries, as loss of a
   customer affects revenues and brand image and acquiring new customers is
   difficult. Reliable predictive models for customer churn could be useful
   in devising customer retention plans. We survey and compare some major
   machine learning techniques that have been used to build predictive
   customer churn models. Employee churn (or attrition) closely related but
   not identical to customer churn is similarly painful for an
   organization, leading to disruptions, customer dissatisfaction and time
   and efforts lost in finding and training replacement. We present a case
   study that we carried out for building and comparing predictive employee
   churn models. We also propose a simple value model for employees that
   can be used to identify how many of the churned employees were
   "valuable". This work has the potential for designing better employee
   retention plans and improving employee satisfaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB The analysis of social communities related logs has recently received
   considerable attention for its importance in shedding light on social
   concerns by identifying different groups, and hence helps in resolving
   issues like predicting terrorist groups. In the customer analysis
   domain, identifying calling communities can be used for determining a
   particular customer's value according to the general pattern behavior of
   the community that the customer belongs to; this helps the effective
   targeted marketing design, which is Significantly important for
   increasing profitability. In telecommunication industry, machine
   learning techniques have been applied to the Call Detail Record (CDR)
   for predicting customer behavior such as churn prediction. In this
   paper, we pursue identifying the calling communities and demonstrate how
   cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify communities using
   information derived from the CDR data. We use the information extracted
   from the cluster analysis to identify customer calling patterns.
   Customers calling patterns are then given to a classification algorithm
   to generate a classifier model for predicting the calling communities of
   a customer. We apply different machine learning techniques to build
   classifier models and compare them in terms of classification accuracy
   and computational performance. The reported test results demonstrate the
   applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2008

AB Highly unbalanced. data sets occur frequently in many practical
   applications and quite often the class of interest in such data sets is
   just a minority class. Like most standard machine learning methods,
   traditional rough sets based rule learning algorithms do not usually
   work well on highly unbalanced data sets. In this paper, we present a
   minority class rule learning algorithm for a highly unbalanced
   inconsistent data set where the class of interest is the minority one.
   The proposed algorithm pivots on discovery of the main features that
   discriminate the minority class from majority classes by finding the so
   called dominant minority subset. An. illustrative example and a real
   application to customer churning prediction in Telecom are given to
   show. the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Customer Chum Prediction is an increasingly pressing issue in today's
   ever-competitive commercial arena. Although there are several researches
   in chum prediction, but the accuracy rate, which is very important to
   business, is not high enough. Recently, Support Vector Machines (SVMs),
   based on statistical learning theory, are gaining applications in the
   areas of data mining, machine learning, computer vision and pattern
   recognition because of high accuracy and good generalization capability.
   But there has no report about using SVM to Customer Churn Prediction.
   According to chum data set characteristic, the number of negative
   examples is very small, we introduce an improved one-class SVM. And we
   have tested our method on the wireless industry customer chum data set.
   Our method has been shown to perform very well compared with other

AB Machine learning techniques have been used to predict customer behavior
   in telecommunications industry. Typically, several data sources,
   including historical usage, billing, payment, network, customer service,
   and demographic data, can be used in a predictive model. However, in
   some cases, e.g., in the prepaid customer segment, there is often little
   data available except for the Call Detail Record (CDR) data. In this
   paper, we tackle this challenging problem, using significantly delayed
   CDR data as the primary data source to predict customer behavior. We
   extract calling links, i.e., who called whom, from the CDR data, and
   propose several distance measures based on calling links. We demonstrate
   that, by using information derived from the calling links alone as
   inputs to a neural network model, an acceptable accuracy for predicting
   churn (customer switching from one service provider to another) can be
   achieved. Calling links can also be used to identify calling
   communities, which may be used for targeted marketing campaigns and help
   predict acceptance of marketing offers.

AB We develop an innovative sequential data mining system for mining the
   customers' churning behaviors for the telecommunications industry.
   Recently, an increasing number of telecommunications customers are
   switching from one service or service provider to another. This
   phenomenon is called 'churn', which is a major cause of corporations'
   loss of profitability. It is important for a telecommunications company
   to find out the transitional behavior of its customers through data
   mining. Our approach is to use a model-based clustering method, extended
   to handle multi dimensional data, to automatically and efficiently
   partition the customer behavior according to their behavior. We model
   this problem as a. sequential clustering problem, and present an
   effective solution for solving the problem when the elements in the
   sequences are of a multi-dimensional nature. We provide theory and
   algorithms for the task, and empirically demonstrate that the method is
   effective in mining the customers data for the telecommunications
   industry.

AB Fierce competition in many industries causes switching behavior of
   customers. Because foregone profits of defected customers are
   significant, an increase of the retention rate can be very profitable.
   In this paper, we focus on the treatment of companies' most promising
   current customers in a non-contractual setting. We build a model in
   order to predict chum behavior of top clients who will (partially)
   defect in the near future. We applied the following classification
   techniques: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic
   discriminant analysis, C4.5, neural networks and Naive Bayes. Their
   performance is quantified by the classification accuracy and the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The
   experiments were carried out on a real life data set obtained by a
   Belgian retailer. The article contributes in many ways. The results show
   that past customer behavior has predictive power to indicate future
   partial defection. This finding is from a companies' point of view even
   more important than being able to define total defectors, which was
   until now the traditional goal in attrition research. It was found that
   neural networks performed better than the other classification
   techniques in terms of both classification accuracy and AUROC. Although
   the performance benefits are sometimes small in absolute terms, they are
   statistically significant and relevant from a marketing perspective.
   Finally it was found that the number of past shop visits and the time
   between past shop incidences are amongst the most predictive inputs for
   the problem at hand.

AB Customer churn, switching from one service provider to another, costs
   the wireless telecommunications industry $4 billion each year in North
   America and Europe. To proactively build lasting relationships with
   customers, it is thus crucial to predict customer behavior. Machine
   learning has been applied to churn prediction, using historical data
   such as usage, billing, customer service, and demographics. However,
   because customer behavior is often nonstationary, training a model based
   on data extracted from a window of time in the past yields poor
   performance on the present. We propose two distinct approaches, using
   more historical data or new, unlabeled data, to improve the results for
   this real-world, large-scale, nonstationary problem. A new ensemble
   classification method, with combination weights learned from both
   labeled and unlabeled data, is also proposed, and it outperforms Bagging
   and Mixture of Experts.

AB Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry is fierce. To
   maintain profitability, wireless carriers must control churn, which is
   the loss of subscribers who switch from one carrier to another, We
   explore techniques from statistical machine learning to predict churn
   and, based on these predictions, to determine what incentives should be
   offered to subscribers to improve retention and maximize profitability
   to the carrier. The techniques include legit regression, decision trees,
   neural networks, and boosting. Our experiments are based on a database
   of nearly 47 000 U.S. domestic subscribers and includes information
   about their usage, billing, credit, application, and complaint history.
   Our experiments show that under a wide variety of assumptions concerning
   the cost of intervention and the retention rate resulting from
   intervention, using predictive techniques to identify potential churners
   and offering incentives can yield significant savings to a carrier. We
   also show the importance of a data representation crafted by domain
   experts. Finally, we report on a real-world test of the techniques that
   validate our simulation experiments.
