AB Customer churn management focuses on identifying potential churners and
   implementing incentives that can cure churn. The success of a churn
   management program depends on accurately identifying potential churners
   and understanding what conditions contribute to churn. However, in the
   presence of uncertainties in the process of churn, such as competing
   risks and unpredictable customer behaviour, the accuracy of the
   prediction models can be limited. To overcome this, we employ a
   competing risk methodology within a random survival forest framework
   that accurately computes the risks of churn and identifies relationships
   between the risks and customer behaviour. In contrast to existing
   methods, the proposed model does not rely on a specific functional form
   to model the relationships between risk and behaviour, and does not have
   underlying distributional assumptions, both of which are limitations
   faced in practice. The performance of the method is evaluated using data
   from a membership-based firm in the hospitality industry, where
   customers face two competing churning events. The proposed model
   improves prediction accuracy by up to 20%, compared to conventional
   models. The findings from this work can allow marketers to identify and
   understand churners, and develop strategies on how to design and
   implement incentives.

AB Predicting future customer behavior provides key information for
   efficiently directing resources at sales and marketing departments. Such
   information supports planning the inventory at the warehouse and point
   of sales, as well strategic decisions during manufacturing processes. In
   this paper, we develop advanced analytics tools that predict future
   customer behavior in the non-contractual setting. We establish a dynamic
   and data driven framework for predicting whether a customer is going to
   make purchase at the company within a certain time frame in the near
   future. For that purpose, we propose a new set of customer relevant
   features that derives from times and values of previous purchases. These
   customer features are updated every month, and state of the art machine
   learning algorithms are applied for purchase prediction. In our studies,
   the gradient tree boosting method turns out to be the best performing
   method. Using a data set containing more than 10000 customers and a
   total number of 200000 purchases we obtain an accuracy score of 89% and
   an AUC value of 0.95 for predicting next moth purchases on the test data
   set. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Churn prediction is the practice of assigning a probability to the event
   of a customer ending his contract with a service provider. Traditional
   data mining approaches to churn prediction in telecommunications
   industry are based on detecting patterns from customer contractual
   information, traffic related data, bills and payments, CRM data and
   customer service logs. The study presented in this paper has employed
   various machine learning approaches and assessed their performances
   using the data of a European mobile operator. The feature importance
   rankings which were used for feature selection yielded also some initial
   guidelines for acting on churn prevention in practice.

   churn prediction is a well known area in Machine Learning research. Many
   companies, however, face a data science skills gap when trying to
   translate this research onto their own datasets and IT infrastructure.
   In this paper we present a series of experiments that aim to predict
   customer behaviour, in order to increase gym utilisation and customer
   retention. We use two off-the-shelf machine learning platforms, so that
   we can evaluate whether these platforms, used by non ML experts, can
   help companies improve their services.

TI Using machine learning techniques to predict defection of top clients

PD 2002

AB Fierce competition in many industries causes switching behavior of
   customers. Because foregone profits of defected customers are
   significant, an increase of the retention rate can be very profitable.
   In this paper, we focus on the treatment of companies' most promising
   current customers in a non-contractual setting. We build a model in
   order to predict chum behavior of top clients who will (partially)
   defect in the near future. We applied the following classification
   techniques: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic
   discriminant analysis, C4.5, neural networks and Naive Bayes. Their
   performance is quantified by the classification accuracy and the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The
   experiments were carried out on a real life data set obtained by a
   Belgian retailer. The article contributes in many ways. The results show
   that past customer behavior has predictive power to indicate future
   partial defection. This finding is from a companies' point of view even
   more important than being able to define total defectors, which was
   until now the traditional goal in attrition research. It was found that
   neural networks performed better than the other classification
   techniques in terms of both classification accuracy and AUROC. Although
   the performance benefits are sometimes small in absolute terms, they are
   statistically significant and relevant from a marketing perspective.
   Finally it was found that the number of past shop visits and the time
   between past shop incidences are amongst the most predictive inputs for
   the problem at hand.
