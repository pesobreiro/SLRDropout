Construction of a Bank Customer Data Warehouse and an Application of Data Mining;In this era of strong competition, data mining can provide effective support to bank operators in their effort to analyze and forecast the real needs of their customers. Applying bank data mining results to the actual business enables banks to develop products that not only meet customer needs but also deliver maximum bank profitability. In this paper, a data mining model for bank customers is established, and after extraction and transformation, the data are loaded into a data warehouse specifically built for that purpose. Using the data mining platform, we conduct multidimensional analysis of the customer information to uncover characteristics of their preferences. The goal of this research is to help facilitate new ideas and methods for the analysis and prediction of bank customer data.;Bank customer information, data mining, data warehouse, multidimensional data analysis;Cui, Shaoying and Ding, Ning;10.1145/3195106.3195178
Scalable Clustering and Applications;"Large scale machine learning is becoming an active research area recently. Most of the existing clustering algorithms cannot handle big data due to its high time and space complexity. Among the clustering algorithms, eigen vector based clustering, such as Spectral clustering, shows very good accuracy, but it has cubic time complexity. There are various methods proposed to reduce the time and space complexity for eigen decomposition such as Nyström method, Lanc-zos method etc. Nyström method has linear time complexity in terms of number of data points, but has cubic time complexity in terms of number of sampling points. To reduce this, various Rank k approximation methods also proposed, but which are less efficient compare to the normalized spectral clustering. In this paper we propose a two step algorithm for spectral clustering to reduce the time complexity toO(nmk + m2k'), by combining both Nyström and Lanczos method, where k is the number of clusters and k' is the rank k approximation of the sampling matrix (k &lt; k' &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; n). It shows very good results, with various data sets, image segmentation problems and churn prediction of a telecommunication data set, even with very low sampling (for 10 Million \texttimes{} 10 Million matrix, sampled only 100 columns) with lesser time, which confirms the validity of the algorithm.";large scale machine learning, segmentation and grouping;I, Shahid K and Chaudhury, Santanu;10.1145/3009977.3010073
A Case Study for the Churn Prediction in Turksat Internet Service Subscription;Churn prediction is a customer relationship process that predicts for customers who are at the brink of transferring all the business to competitor. It is predicted by modeling customer behaviors in order to extract patterns. An acquaintance of a customer is more costly than retainment of an existing customer. Churn predictions shed light on members about to leave the service and support promotion activities. These attempts are utilized to avoid subscription cancellation of existing customers. Nowadays, telecommunication companies take churn prediction very serious. They strive for monitoring customers in the business by using various applications in systematic approach. Our study is based on leading internet service providing company, Turksat Satellite Communications and Cable TV Operations Company's customer behavior analysis. It is the leading internet service provider of Turkey operating in telecommunications sector. We have created a two-phase solution utilizing data mining techniques. These are time series clustering and classification techniques.;Customer relationship management, data mining, time series clustering, hierarchical clustering, recursive partitioning, churn prediction, classification, support vector machines, k-means clustering;Gök, Mehmet and Özyer, Tansel and Jida, Jamal;10.1145/2808797.2808821
Comprehensible Classification Models: A Position Paper;The vast majority of the literature evaluates the performance of classification models using only the criterion of predictive accuracy. This paper reviews the case for considering also the comprehensibility (interpretability) of classification models, and discusses the interpretability of five types of classification models, namely decision trees, classification rules, decision tables, nearest neighbors and Bayesian network classifiers. We discuss both interpretability issues which are specific to each of those model types and more generic interpretability issues, namely the drawbacks of using model size as the only criterion to evaluate the comprehensibility of a model, and the use of monotonicity constraints to improve the comprehensibility and acceptance of classification models by users.;decision tree, monotonicity constraint, nearest neighbors, Bayesian network classifiers, decision table, rule induction;Freitas, Alex A.;10.1145/2594473.2594475
Bregman Bubble Clustering: A Robust Framework for Mining Dense Clusters;"In classical clustering, each data point is assigned to at least one cluster. However, in many applications only a small subset of the available data is relevant for the problem and the rest needs to be ignored in order to obtain good clusters. Certain nonparametric density-based clustering methods find the most relevant data as multiple dense regions, but such methods are generally limited to low-dimensional data and do not scale well to large, high-dimensional datasets. Also, they use a specific notion of “distance”, typically Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance, which further limits their applicability. On the other hand, the recent One Class Information Bottleneck (OC-IB) method is fast and works on a large class of distortion measures known as Bregman Divergences, but can only find a single dense region. This article presents a broad framework for finding k dense clusters while ignoring the rest of the data. It includes a seeding algorithm that can automatically determine a suitable value for k. When k is forced to 1, our method gives rise to an improved version of OC-IB with optimality guarantees. We provide a generative model that yields the proposed iterative algorithm for finding k dense regions as a special case. Our analysis reveals an interesting and novel connection between the problem of finding dense regions and exponential mixture models; a hard model corresponding to k exponential mixtures with a uniform background results in a set of k dense clusters. The proposed method describes a highly scalable algorithm for finding multiple dense regions that works with any Bregman Divergence, thus extending density based clustering to a variety of non-Euclidean problems not addressable by earlier methods. We present empirical results on three artificial, two microarray and one text dataset to show the relevance and effectiveness of our methods.";expectation maximization, One Class classification, exponential family, Density-based clustering, Bregman divergences;Gupta, Gunjan and Ghosh, Joydeep;10.1145/1376815.1376817
The State-of-the-Art in Twitter Sentiment Analysis: A Review and Benchmark Evaluation;Twitter has emerged as a major social media platform and generated great interest from sentiment analysis researchers. Despite this attention, state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment analysis approaches perform relatively poorly with reported classification accuracies often below 70%, adversely impacting applications of the derived sentiment information. In this research, we investigate the unique challenges presented by Twitter sentiment analysis and review the literature to determine how the devised approaches have addressed these challenges. To assess the state-of-the-art in Twitter sentiment analysis, we conduct a benchmark evaluation of 28 top academic and commercial systems in tweet sentiment classification across five distinctive data sets. We perform an error analysis to uncover the causes of commonly occurring classification errors. To further the evaluation, we apply select systems in an event detection case study. Finally, we summarize the key trends and takeaways from the review and benchmark evaluation and provide suggestions to guide the design of the next generation of approaches.;social media, benchmark evaluation, twitter, Sentiment analysis, natural language processing, opinion mining, text mining;Zimbra, David and Abbasi, Ahmed and Zeng, Daniel and Chen, Hsinchun;10.1145/3185045
SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data;"Welcome to SIGMOD 2015 -- officially, the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on the Management of Data! This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, ""The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery"" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, ""From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed,"" explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, ""Three Favorite Results,"" on Tuesday. Christopher Ré will lead a panel on ""Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?,"" with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers.

The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.";;;
Nonparametric Hierarchal Bayesian Modeling in Non-Contractual Heterogeneous Survival Data;"An important problem in the non-contractual marketing domain is discovering the customer lifetime and assessing the impact of customer's characteristic variables on the lifetime. Unfortunately, the conventional hierarchical Bayes model cannot discern the impact of customer's characteristic variables for each customer. To overcome this problem, we present a new survival model using a non-parametric Bayes paradigm with MCMC. The assumption of a conventional model, logarithm of purchase rate and dropout rate with linear regression, is extended to include our assumption of the Dirichlet Process Mixture of regression. The extension assumes that each customer belongs probabilistically to different mixtures of regression, thereby permitting us to estimate a different impact of customer characteristic variables for each customer. Our model creates several customer groups to mirror the structure of the target data set.The effectiveness of our proposal is confirmed by a comparison involving a real e-commerce transaction dataset and an artificial dataset; it generally achieves higher predictive performance. In addition, we show that preselecting the actual number of customer groups does not always lead to higher predictive performance.";model choice, mcmc, non-parametric bayes, crm;Nagano, Shouichi and Ichikawa, Yusuke and Takaya, Noriko and Uchiyama, Tadasu and Abe, Makoto;10.1145/2487575.2487590
Clustering analysis of broadband customers and its application in marketing;The thesis briefly introduced data mining and clustering theories. Also through K-Means, ADSL voice multiplex customers are clustered, which caused over 240,000 customers divided into 8 clusters. Further analysis showed that the 8 clusters had distinct differences in basic characters and surfing the net.

Customer Review Analytics using Subjective Loss Function for Conceptual-based Learning;Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently among the most commonly used machine learning methods in content understanding such as computer vision and natural language understanding (NLU). One of the best characteristics of these methods is their modular design - the ability to change the connectivity patterns of layers, try different activation functions, inject different statistical approaches such as normalization and dropout in the network, and many other actions - in every aspect of deep learning networks. While the majority of deep learning applications simply use cross-entropy, L1, and L2 losses, subjective loss function can actually result in impressive performance improvement. In addition, architecting the last layer of DNNs - referred to as the prediction layer - according to the needs of the application increases the discriminative power of the DNNs. This paper aims to investigate how particular choices of loss functions and prediction layer architecture affect deep neural networks and their learning dynamics, as well as the robustness of various effects. Furthermore a real-life application to measure customer loyalty called Deep Net Promoter Score (DeepNPS) from online product reviews is also proposed. The results are promising for learning more latent features and matching the customer feedback with the NPS score.;"computer vision;customer satisfaction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;statistical analysis;transfer functions;customer loyalty;online product reviews;customer review analytics;deep neural networks;DNNs;computer vision;natural language understanding;modular design;deep learning networks;loss functions;prediction layer architecture;learning dynamics;activation functions;statistical approaches;conceptual-based learning;machine learning methods;L1 losses;L2 losses;deep net promoter sc";S.

Microblog users' life time activity prediction;As the fast development of online social media, social network services have become an important research area nowadays. Particularly, microblog as new social media needs more attention. Most of current studies are usually static descriptions or explanations of what already has happened. Limited study has been conducted focusing on SNS users and analysing their behaviors dynamically. In this paper, we firstly segment microblog users based on the recency and frequency of tweet and retweet behavior, then use probability models such as Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD to predict customer lifetime vitality. Our results showed that both Pareto/NBD model and BG/NBD model showed effective ability to fit and predict SNS users' usage behavior on microblog website. Tweet behaviors of sustainably active user base are more suitable for the probability models. Managerial implications of the two models should be highlighted as well. Interaction rate and dropout rate can be considered as the vitality index of the whole user base measuring how active users are and how likely a user is active. Managerial questions such as how active the users are in this platform now and how active the users will be in the future can be answered by applying those models.;"behavioural sciences computing;human computer interaction;probability;social networking (online);microblog user life time activity prediction;online social media;social network services;static descriptions;SNS users;behavior analysis;microblog user segmentation;retweet behavior;probability models;customer lifetime vitality prediction;Pareto/NBD model;BG/NBD model;usage behavior;microblog Website;sustainably active user base;managerial implications;interaction rate;dropout rate;vitality index;Pre";J. {Jin} and X. {Chen} and R. {Geng} and S. {Cai};10.1109/ICSSSM.2013.6602505
Aspect Extraction from Customer Reviews Using Convolutional Neural Networks;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have emerged as a viable solution for text classification, including aspect extraction. Yet the existing state-of-the-art CNN architectures used in aspect extraction do not incorporate improvements (e.g. non-static CNN, multi-kernel convolution layers, and dropout regularization) that have been identified as beneficial for general text classification tasks. In this research, we present an improved CNN architecture with these enhancements for aspect extraction. Our modifications to the basic CNN model improve feature extraction of the convolutional layer, while allowing the dense layers to represent complex non-linear relationships between selected features and the output layer. Furthermore, we show that using non-static CNN instead of static CNN further fine-tunes the word embedding features for the specific domain of customer reviews in the absence of domain-specific corpora to train word2Vec models. We show that using Skip-gram trained word2vec models opposed to Continuous bag of word (CBOW) architecture improves the quality of word2vec embedding features for aspect extraction and text classification tasks. This new CNN model and baseline CNN are evaluated using SemEval-2016 Task 5 Restaurant and Laptop domain datasets. Our CNN model shows significant improvements over the baseline CNN model for aspect extraction from customer reviews for both restaurant and laptop domains. It also outperforms the currently available state-of-the-art systems for restaurant domain.;"consumer behaviour;convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis;aspect extraction;general text classification tasks;improved CNN architecture;basic CNN model;feature extraction;convolutional layer;static CNN;customer reviews;baseline CNN model;domain-specific corpora;convolutional neural networks;skip-gram trained word2vec models;nonstatic CNN;state-of-the-art CNN architectures;restaurant domain datasets;laptop doma";N. {Jihan} and Y. {Senarath} and S. {Ranathunga};10.1109/ICTER.2018.8615575

Implementation of a integrated algorithm for voltage variation and flicker measurements;"Recently, voltage variation and flicker events in a power system are concerned by both of utility and customers. Actually, these two events are always measured separately, but in a certain cases they can happen successively. Voltage variation may cause equipments dropout or failure and result in huge economic losses; while voltage flicker will interfere human vision. In order to discriminate voltage variation from flicker in real time, this paper propose a virtual instrumentation system to implement a integrated algorithm which can complete the measurements of both events. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can effectively differentiate between voltage variation and flicker; besides, the field tests also validate the capability of the virtual instrument.";"power distribution faults;power engineering computing;power supply quality;virtual instrumentation;voltage measurement;integrated algorithm implementation;voltage variation measurement;flicker measurement;power quality;equipment dropout;equipment failure;virtual instrumentation system;Voltage fluctuations;Instruments;Power quality;Performance evaluation;Humans;Frequency;Electric variables measurement;System testing;Power system measurements;Power system economics;power quality;voltage variation;";M. {Chen} and C. {Lu} and C. {Lin};10.1109/IMTC.2010.5488654

Power quality index meter;The increased sensitivity of power electronics equipment results in high susceptibility of industrial customers to short term voltage variations such as sags and swells. Many utilities are publishing power quality index values to indicate overall quality of their distribution systems. In this study, a real time Power Quality Index Meter that combines the detection of disturbances and the calculation of required power quality indices is proposed. The real time index metering eliminates the need for extended memory and greatly reduces subsequent data processing efforts.;"power supply quality;power electronics;voltage measurement;power system measurement;power quality index meter;real time measurement;disturbances detection;system RMS variation;power electronic equipment;SLARFI;SMARFI;STARFI;weighted event aggregation method;worst component;total duration;frequency of occurrence indices;voltage variations;pickup threshold;dropout threshold;pickup delay;dropout delay;Power quality;Voltage;Frequency;Electrical equipment industry;Power electronics;Electronics indust";L. {Eren} and M.

Course Experience Evaluation using Importance-Performance Analysis;Measures of students' satisfaction are often used for the evaluation of course quality in tertiary education, aiming to improve students achievement and reduce dropout phenomena. In general, students' satisfaction rates are proportionally related to course quality and students' achievement. Satisfaction evaluation methods were traditionally used in marketing for the evaluation of services or products. The analysis of the influential factors offers practitioners the means to identify problems, as well as, the chance to prioritize the appropriate measures for improvement, based on expected performance and anticipated cost. Teaching instructors, on the other hand, can differentiate their teaching according to students' perceptions. In the present work, an adapted version of the Course Experience Questionnaire was used to measure students' satisfaction. The 36-item scale, widely used in tertiary education for course assessment, examines a variety of factors along with total satisfaction. Utilizing importance-performance analysis the strengths and the weaknesses of the course were highlighted. The methodology proposed, offers educators a tool to identify the critical factors that affect students' satisfaction, and prioritize necessary interventions for the improvement of course performance.;"customer satisfaction;educational courses;teaching;Course Experience evaluation;course quality;tertiary education;students achievement;satisfaction evaluation methods;Course Experience Questionnaire;course assessment;course performance;influential factors;importance-performance analysis;Tools;Computer science;Instruments;Engineering education;Conferences;Appraisal;course evaluation;course experience questionnaire;importance-performance analysis;computer science;secondary education";I. {Sitaridis} and F. {Kitsios};10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725275
Prediction of Cloud Resources Demand Based on Fuzzy Deep Neural Network;In this information explosion age, processing and storing the vast data sometimes are intractable problems. To cope with the challenges, fog computing is proposed, which is good at handling the real-time tasks but the service price can be correspondingly more expensive. In order to harvest more profits and get more users, the companies that offer cloud services also carry out the reservation selling strategy, whose price is relatively cheaper. For the purpose of minimizing the cost of using cloud services, this paper proposes a fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) based method to predict the demand of cloud resources. Besides the utilization of fuzzy logic, in the phase of network training, the back-propagation algorithm, adaptively varied learning rate and the dropout strategy are also employed. According to the network predictions, the customers are able to decide how many resources to reserve so as to minimize their expenses most. Simulation results based on the real data sets from Carnegie Mellon University show that the proposed method gives the economical predictions and outperforms the traditional deep neural network.;"cloud computing;data handling;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;cloud resources demand;information explosion age;fog computing;service price;cloud services;reservation selling strategy;fuzzy deep neural network based method;fuzzy logic;network training;dropout strategy;network predictions;economical predictions;deep neural network;Carnegie Mellon University;FDNN;Cloud computing;Training;Neural networks;Data models;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy logic;Task analysis";D. {Chen} and X. {Zhang} and L. {Wang} and Z. {Han};10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647765
Real-Time Event-Based Dynamic Multi-Facility Vehicle Rerouting;This paper presents a system architecture for real-time information transmission between the dispatcher and service vehicles allowing the logistic system the possibility of reacting to dynamic events such as new service requests and dropouts in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This paper focuses on a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) called the capacitated multi-depot vehicle routing problem and takes into consideration the dynamic nature of the system. To obtain real-time solutions to the routing problem, a new two-stage algorithm is detailed that makes use of various heuristics and local search metaheuristics to generate high-quality solutions to facilitate real-time decision-making. The proposed methodology creates an initial route plan for the predetermined requests and then modifies the original route as new events (customer requests) are available over time. The performance of proposed rerouting algorithms demonstrated in a simulated framework with two depots and four vehicles.;"Internet of Things;logistics;search problems;vehicle routing;system architecture;real-time information transmission;service vehicles;logistic system;dynamic events;service requests;Internet of Things paradigm;capacitated multidepot vehicle routing problem;real-time solutions;high-quality solutions;real-time decision-making;initial route plan;local search metaheuristics;real-time event-based dynamic multifacility vehicle rerouting;Vehicle Routing;Industry 4.0;Tabu search;Path Cheapest Arc;Real-Ti";A. {Madhu} and R. {Harikrishnakumar} and S. {Nannapaneni} and K. {Krishnan};10.1109/ISORC49007.2020.00034
GPS/INS uses low-cost MEMS IMU;A description of the design, operation, and test results of a miniature, low-cost, integrated GPS/inertial navigation system that uses commercial off-the-shelf micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes. The MEMS inertial measurement unit (EMU) is packaged in a small size and provides the raw EMU data through a serial interface to a processor board where the inertial navigation solution and integrated GPS/inertial Kalman filter is generated. The GPS/inertial software integration is performed using NAVSYS' modular InterNav software product. This allows integration with different low-cost GPS chip sets or receivers and also allows the integrated GPS/inertial navigation solution to be embedded as an application on a customer's host computer. This modular object-oriented architecture facilitates integration of the miniature MEMS GPS/INS navigation system for embedded navigation applications and is designed to handle the large errors characteristic of a low-grade MEMS IMU. Test results are presented showing the performance of the integrated MEMS GPS/inertial navigation system. Data is provided showing the position, velocity, and attitude accuracy when operating with GPS aiding and also for periods where GPS dropouts occur and alternative navigation update sources are used to bound the MEMS inertial navigation error growth.;"inertial navigation;Global Positioning System;aircraft navigation;micromechanical devices;accelerometers;gyroscopes;aircraft instrumentation;object-oriented methods;Kalman filters;MEMS IMU;miniature navigation system;low-cost navigation systen;integrated GPS/inertial navigation system;commercial off-the-shelf micro-electro-mechanical system;accelerometers;gyroscopes;MEMS inertial measurement unit;Kalman filter;GPS/inertial software integration;modular InterNav software product;low-cost GPS chip ";A.

Load prediction methods using machine learning for home energy management systems based on human behavior patterns recognition;Load forecasting can enhance the reliability and efficiency of operations in a home energy management system (HEMS). The rise of big data with machine learning in recent years makes it a potential solution. This paper proposes two new energy load forecasting methods, enhancing the traditional sequence to sequence long short-term memory (S2S-LSTM) model. Method 1 integrates S2S-LSTM with human behavior patterns recognition, implemented and compared by 3 types of algorithms: density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), K-means and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Among them, PCC is proven to be better than the others and suitable for a large number of residential customers. Method 2 further improves Method 1's performance with a modified multi-layer Neural Network architecture, which is constituted by fully-connected, dropout and stable improved softmax layers. It optimizes the process of supervised learning in LSTM and improves the stability and accuracy of the prediction model. The performances of both proposed methods are evaluated on a dataset of 8-week electricity consumptions from 2337 residential customers.;"Load modeling;Predictive models;Pattern recognition;Clustering algorithms;Recurrent neural networks;Cluster analysis;home energy management systems;long short-term memory;machine learning;neural network";L. {Fan} and J. {Li} and X. {Zhang};10.17775/CSEEJPES.2018.01130
Identifying student retention patterns using GIS technology;Geographic information systems (GIS) have been used successfully by personnel in government, business, and industry to map natural resource data, determine socioeconomic boundaries, and manage fleet routing activities. The diverse applications of GIS have made its use attractive to people in many professions. However, educators have not used this technological tool as extensively even though they acquire a large amount of student data. Similar to business owners, it is helpful for administrators in higher education to understand their student/customer base in order to meet their needs and retain them. The author obtained student addresses at both a Midwestern and Western university and mapped them onto a GIS system. Spatial analysis was used to determine whether there were geographic differences among students who dropped out of school, remained enrolled, or successfully graduated within six years of matriculation. Differences were found among the student groups. Geographic distance did not make a difference for dropouts or graduates. However, living near the universities was significant for students who remained in school. Proximity to classes is important for many students to continue their education and ultimately graduate. Additional research using GIS can assist educators in finding off-site campus locations near the greatest concentration of students.;"educational administrative data processing;geographic information systems;student retention patterns;GIS technology;geographic information systems;socioeconomic boundaries;fleet routing activities;spatial analysis;Geographic Information Systems;Educational institutions;Technology management;Environmental economics;Management information systems;Personnel;Government;Routing;Continuing education;Psychology";C. {Hanewicz};10.1109/PICMET.2009.5261844

A {Case} of {Churn} {Prediction} in {Telecommunications} {Industry};Churn prediction is the practice of assigning a probability to the event of a customer ending his contract with a service provider. Traditional data mining approaches to churn prediction in telecommunications industry are based on detecting patterns from customer contractual information, traffic related data, bills and payments, CRM data and customer service logs. The study presented in this paper has employed various machine learning approaches and assessed their performances using the data of a European mobile operator. The feature importance rankings which were used for feature selection yielded also some initial guidelines for acting on churn prevention in practice.;churn, data mining, feature selection, feature-selection, optimization, stacking, telecommunications;Brmez, Simon and Znidarsic, Martin;

Using machine learning techniques to preduct defection of top clients;Fierce competition in many industries causes switching behavior of customers. Because foregone profits of defected customers are significant, an increase of the retention rate can be very profitable. In this paper, we focus on the treatment of companies' most promising current customers in a non-contractual setting. We build a model in order to predict churn behavior of top clients who will (partially) defect in the near future. We applied the following classification techniques: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, C4.5, neural networks and Naive Bayes. Their performance is quantified by the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The experiments were carried out on a real life data set obtained by a Belgian retailer. The article contributes in many ways. The results show that past customer behavior has predictive power to indicate future partial defection. This finding is from a companies' point of view even more important than being able to define total defectors, which was until now the traditional goal in attrition research. It was found that neural networks performed better than the other classification techniques in terms of both classification accuracy and AUROC. Although the performance benefits are sometimes small in absolute terms, they are statistically significant and relevant from a marketing perspective. Finally it was found that the number of past shop visits and the time between past shop incidences are amongst the most predictive inputs for the problem at hand.;;Buckinx, W. and Baesens, Bart and Van den Poel, D. and Van Kenhove, P. and Vanthienen, Jan;

Churn prediction model for effective gym customer retention;In the fitness industry, rolling gym membership contracts allow customers to terminate a contract with little advanced notice. Customer churn prediction is a well known area in Machine Learning research. Many companies, however, face a data science skills gap when trying to translate this research onto their own datasets and IT infrastructure. In this paper we present a series of experiments that aim to predict customer behaviour, in order to increase gym utilisation and customer retention. We use two off-the-shelf machine learning platforms, so that we can evaluate whether these platforms, used by non ML experts, can help companies improve their services.;"customer relationship management;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);fitness industry;gym membership contracts;customer churn prediction;customer behaviour;gym utilisation;rolling gym membership contracts;off-the-shelf machine learning platforms;gym customer retention;Contracts;Companies;Predictive models;Industries;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;customer churn;gym attendance;machine learning";J. {Semrl} and A. {Matei};10.1109/BESC.2017.8256385
