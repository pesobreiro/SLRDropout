Abstract

To improve the prediction abilities of machine learning methods, a support vector machine (SVM) on structural risk minimization was applied to customer churn prediction. Researching customer churn prediction cases both in home and foreign carries, the method was compared with artifical neural network, decision tree, logistic regression, and naive bayesian classifier. It is found that the method enjoys the best accuracy rate, hit rate, covering rate, and lift coefficient, and therefore, provides an effective measurement for customer churn prediction.
