	shorttitle = {Retention Futility},
	abstract = {Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.},

Our contributions include the following: (1) the effects of interpersonal influence on prediction accuracy are evaluated while including determinants that other researchers proved effective, and several models are constructed based on machine learning and statistical methods and compared, assuring the validity of the evaluation; and (2) a novel prediction model based on interpersonal influence and information propagation is proposed. The dataset used in the empirical study was obtained from a leading mobile telecommunication service provider and contains the traditional and network attributes of over one million customers. The empirical results show that traditional classification models that incorporate interpersonal influence can greatly improve prediction accuracy, and our proposed prediction model outperforms the traditional models.},

In churn prediction, an important yet challenging problem is the imbalance in the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method, called improved balanced random forests ({IBRF}), and demonstrate its application to churn prediction. We investigate the effectiveness of the standard random forests approach in predicting customer churn, while also integrating sampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning into the approach to achieve a better performance than most existing algorithms. The nature of {IBRF} is that the best features are iteratively learned by altering the class distribution and by putting higher penalties on misclassification of the minority class. We apply the method to a real bank customer churn data set. It is found to improve prediction accuracy significantly compared with other algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, and class-weighted core support vector machines ({CWC}-{SVM}). Moreover, {IBRF} also produces better prediction results than other random forests algorithms such as balanced random forests and weighted random forests.},

In customer classification, an important yet challenging problem is the imbalance of data distribution. In this paper, we combine ensemble learning with cost-sensitive learning, and propose a dynamic classifier ensemble method for imbalanced data ({DCEID}). For each test customer, it can adaptively select out the more appropriate one from the two kinds of dynamic ensemble approach: dynamic classifier selection ({DCS}) and dynamic ensemble selection ({DES}). Meanwhile, new cost-sensitive selection criteria for {DCS} and {DES} are constructed respectively to improve the classification ability for imbalanced data. We apply this method to a credit scoring dataset in {UCI} and a real churn prediction dataset from a telecommunication company. The experimental results show that the classification performance of {DCEID} is not only better than some static ensemble methods such as weighted random forests and improved balanced random forests, but also better than the existing {DCS} and {DES} strategies.},

	abstract = {As deregulation, new technologies, and new competitors open up the mobile telecommunications industry, churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers. A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated, we propose, design, and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction time-period. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classifier class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore, the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction. Using a previous demographics-based churn-prediction system as a reference, the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory.},

	abstract = {Undoubtedly, the change in consumers’ choices and expectations, stemming from the emerging technology and also significant availability of different products and services, created a highly competitive landscape in various customer service sectors, including the financial industry. Accordingly, the Canadian banking industry has also become highly competitive due to the threats and disruptions caused by not only direct competitors, but also new entrants to the market. The primary objective of this paper is to construct a predictive churn model by utilizing big data, including the structured archival data, integrated with unstructured data from sources such as online web pages, the number of website visits and phone conversation logs, for the first time in the financial industry. It also examines the effect of different aspects of customers’ behavior on churning decisions. The Datameer big data analytics tool on the Hadoop platform and predictive techniques using the {SAS} business intelligence system were applied to study the client retirement journey path and to create a churn prediction model. By deploying the above systems, we were able to uncover a wealth of data and information associated with over 3 million customers’ records within the retiree segment of the target bank, from 2011 to 2015.},

	abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated the superior performance of ensemble classification algorithms, whereby multiple member classifiers are combined into one aggregated and powerful classification model, over single models. In this paper, two rotation-based ensemble classifiers are proposed as modeling techniques for customer churn prediction. In Rotation Forests, feature extraction is applied to feature subsets in order to rotate the input data for training base classifiers, while {RotBoost} combines Rotation Forest with {AdaBoost}. In an experimental validation based on data sets from four real-life customer churn prediction projects, Rotation Forest and {RotBoost} are compared to a set of well-known benchmark classifiers. Moreover, variations of Rotation Forest and {RotBoost} are compared, implementing three alternative feature extraction algorithms: principal component analysis ({PCA}), independent component analysis ({ICA}) and sparse random projections ({SRP}). The performance of rotation-based ensemble classifier is found to depend upon: (i) the performance criterion used to measure classification performance, and (ii) the implemented feature extraction algorithm. In terms of accuracy, {RotBoost} outperforms Rotation Forest, but none of the considered variations offers a clear advantage over the benchmark algorithms. However, in terms of {AUC} and top-decile lift, results clearly demonstrate the competitive performance of Rotation Forests compared to the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, {ICA}-based Rotation Forests outperform all other considered classifiers and are therefore recommended as a well-suited alternative classification technique for the prediction of customer churn that allows for improved marketing decision making.},

Predictive accuracy, comprehensibility, and justifiability are three key aspects of a churn prediction model. An accurate model permits to correctly target future churners in a retention marketing campaign, while a comprehensible and intuitive rule-set allows to identify the main drivers for customers to churn, and to develop an effective retention strategy in accordance with domain knowledge. This paper provides an extended overview of the literature on the use of data mining in customer churn prediction modeling. It is shown that only limited attention has been paid to the comprehensibility and the intuitiveness of churn prediction models. Therefore, two novel data mining techniques are applied to churn prediction modeling, and benchmarked to traditional rule induction techniques such as C4.5 and {RIPPER}. Both {AntMiner}+ and {ALBA} are shown to induce accurate as well as comprehensible classification rule-sets. {AntMiner}+ is a high performing data mining technique based on the principles of Ant Colony Optimization that allows to include domain knowledge by imposing monotonicity constraints on the final rule-set. {ALBA} on the other hand combines the high predictive accuracy of a non-linear support vector machine model with the comprehensibility of the rule-set format. The results of the benchmarking experiments show that {ALBA} improves learning of classification techniques, resulting in comprehensible models with increased performance. {AntMiner}+ results in accurate, comprehensible, but most importantly justifiable models, unlike the other modeling techniques included in this study.},

	abstract = {The analysis of social communities related logs has recently received considerable attention for its importance in shedding light on social concerns by identifying different groups, and hence helps in resolving issues like predicting terrorist groups. In the customer analysis domain, identifying calling communities can be used for determining a particular customer’s value according to the general pattern behavior of the community that the customer belongs to; this helps the effective targeted marketing design, which is significantly important for increasing profitability. In telecommunication industry, machine learning techniques have been applied to the Call Detail Record ({CDR}) for predicting customer behavior such as churn prediction. In this paper, we pursue identifying the calling communities and demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify communities using information derived from the {CDR} data. We use the information extracted from the cluster analysis to identify customer calling patterns. Customers calling patterns are then given to a classification algorithm to generate a classifier model for predicting the calling communities of a customer. We apply different machine learning techniques to build classifier models and compare them in terms of classification accuracy and computational performance. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

With the purpose of retaining customers, academics as well as practitioners find it crucial to build a churn prediction model that is as accurate as possible. This study applies support vector machines in a newspaper subscription context in order to construct a churn model with a higher predictive performance. Moreover, a comparison is made between two parameter-selection techniques, needed to implement support vector machines. Both techniques are based on grid search and cross-validation. Afterwards, the predictive performance of both kinds of support vector machine models is benchmarked to logistic regression and random forests. Our study shows that support vector machines show good generalization performance when applied to noisy marketing data. Nevertheless, the parameter optimization procedure plays an important role in the predictive performance. We show that only when the optimal parameter-selection procedure is applied, support vector machines outperform traditional logistic regression, whereas random forests outperform both kinds of support vector machines. As a substantive contribution, an overview of the most important churn drivers is given. Unlike ample research, monetary value and frequency do not play an important role in explaining churn in this subscription-services application. Even though most important churn predictors belong to the category of variables describing the subscription, the influence of several client/company-interaction variables cannot be neglected.},

	abstract = {Support vector machine ({SVM}) is currently state-of-the-art for classification tasks due to its ability to model nonlinearities. However, the main drawback of {SVM} is that it generates “black box” model, i.e. it does not reveal the knowledge learnt during training in human comprehensible form. The process of converting such opaque models into a transparent model is often regarded as rule extraction. In this paper we proposed a hybrid approach for extracting rules from {SVM} for customer relationship management ({CRM}) purposes. The proposed hybrid approach consists of three phases. (i) During first phase; {SVM}-{RFE} ({SVM}-recursive feature elimination) is employed to reduce the feature set. (ii) Dataset with reduced features is then used in the second phase to obtain {SVM} model and support vectors are extracted. (iii) Rules are then generated using Naive Bayes Tree ({NBTree}) in the final phase. The dataset analyzed in this research study is about Churn prediction in bank credit card customer (Business Intelligence Cup 2004) and it is highly unbalanced with 93.24\% loyal and 6.76\% churned customers. Further we employed various standard balancing approaches to balance the data and extracted rules. It is observed from the empirical results that the proposed hybrid outperformed all other techniques tested. As the reduced feature dataset is used, it is also observed that the proposed approach extracts smaller length rules, thereby improving the comprehensibility of the system. The generated rules act as an early warning expert system to the bank management.},

	abstract = {Customer churn is a critical and challenging problem affecting business and industry, in particular, the rapidly growing, highly competitive telecommunication sector. It is of substantial interest to both academic researchers and industrial practitioners, interested in forecasting the behavior of customers in order to differentiate the churn from non-churn customers. The primary motivation is the dire need of businesses to retain existing customers, coupled with the high cost associated with acquiring new ones. A review of the field has revealed a lack of efficient, rule-based Customer Churn Prediction ({CCP}) approaches in the telecommunication sector. This study proposes an intelligent rule-based decision-making technique, based on rough set theory ({RST}), to extract important decision rules related to customer churn and non-churn. The proposed approach effectively performs classification of churn from non-churn customers, along with prediction of those customers who will churn or may possibly churn in the near future. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposed {RST} based {CCP} approach using four rule-generation mechanisms, namely, the Exhaustive Algorithm ({EA}), Genetic Algorithm ({GA}), Covering Algorithm ({CA}) and the {LEM}2 algorithm ({LA}). Empirical results show that {RST} based on {GA} is the most efficient technique for extracting implicit knowledge in the form of decision rules from the publicly available, benchmark telecom dataset. Further, comparative results demonstrate that our proposed approach offers a globally optimal solution for {CCP} in the telecom sector, when benchmarked against several state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show how attribute-level analysis can pave the way for developing a successful customer retention policy that could form an indispensable part of strategic decision making and planning process in the telecom sector.},

This study aims to find the prominent variables and their conditional dependencies/interrelations that affect student attrition in college settings. Specifically, using a large and feature-rich dataset, proposed methodology successfully captures the probabilistic interactions between attrition (the dependent variable) and related factors (the independent variables) to reveal the underlying, potentially complex/non-linear relationships. The proposed methodology successfully predicts the individual students' attrition risk through a Bayesian Belief Network-driven probabilistic model. The findings suggest that the proposed probabilistic graphical/network method is capable of predicting student attrition with 84\% in {AUC} – Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve. Using a 2-by-2 investigational design framework, this body of research also compares the impact and contribution of data balancing and feature selection to the resultant prediction models. The results show that (1) the imbalanced dataset produces similar predictive results in detecting the at-risk students, and (2) the feature selection, which is the process of identifying and eliminating unnecessary/unimportant predictors, results in simpler, more understandable, interpretable, and actionable results without compromising on the accuracy of the prediction task.},

	abstract = {Customer churn is one of the most challenging problems that affects revenue and customer base in mobile telecom operators. The success of retention campaigns depends not only on the accuracy of predicting potential churners, but with equal importance, it depends on the timing when the prediction is done. Previous works related to churn prediction presented models to predict churn monthly with a focus on the static behavior of customers, and even the studies that considered the dynamic behavior of the customer, looked mainly at the monthly level behavior. However, customer behavior is susceptible to changes over days of month, and during the time leading up to a customer decision to churn, he/she starts behaving differently. Therefore, considering monthly behavioral features negatively affects the predictive performance, because it ignores changes in behavior over days of month. Moreover, predicting churners on monthly basis will be late for customers who decided to leave at the beginning of the month because they will not be detected as churners until the next month. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose daily churn prediction instead of monthly based on the daily dynamic behavior of customer instead of his monthly one. More precisely, we represent customer’s daily behavior as multivariate time series and propose four models to predict churn daily based on this representation. Two models depend on features extracted from the multivariate time series, namely {RFM}-based model and statistics-based model. While the other models, exploit deep learning techniques for automatic feature extraction, namely {LSTM}-based model and {CNN}-based model. The predictive performance of the proposed models were investigated by evaluating them using a 150-day-long dataset collected from {MTN} operator in the country. The results showed that the daily models significantly outperform the monthly models in terms of predicting churners earlier and more accurately. Furthermore, the {LSTM}-based model significantly outperforms the {CNN}-based model. However, the prediction performances of the {LSTM}-based and the {CNN}-based models are equal to the prediction performance of the {RFM}-based model. Moreover, all of these three models significantly outperform the Statistics-based model.},

	abstract = {Customer churn prediction literature has been limited to modeling churn in the next (feasible) time period. On the other hand, lead time specific churn predictions can help businesses to allocate retention efforts across time, as well as customers, and identify early triggers and indicators of customer churn. We propose a dynamic churn prediction framework for generating training data from customer records, and leverage it for predicting customer churn within multiple horizons using standard classifiers. Further, we empirically evaluate the proposed approach in a case study about private banking customers in a European bank. The proposed framework includes customer observations from different time periods, and thus addresses the absolute rarity issue that is relevant for the most valuable customer segment of many companies. It also increases the sampling density in the training data and allows the models to generalize across behaviors in different time periods while incorporating the impact of the environmental drivers. As a result, this framework significantly increases the prediction accuracy across prediction horizons compared to the standard approach of one observation per customer; even when the standard approach is modified with oversampling to balance the data, or lags of customer behavior features are added as additional predictors. The proposed approach to dynamic churn prediction involves a set of independently trained horizon-specific binary classifiers that use the proposed dataset generation framework. In the absence of predictive dynamic churn models, we had to benchmark survival analysis which is used predominantly as a descriptive tool. The proposed method outperforms survival analysis in terms of predictive accuracy for all lead times, with a much lower variability. Further, unlike Cox regression, it provides horizon specific ranking of customers in terms of churn probability which allows allocation of retention efforts across customers and time periods.},

Consequently, new types of information are available which generate new opportunities to increase the prediction power of a churn model.

As a substantive contribution, an in-depth study of the impact of the emotionality indicators on churn behavior is done.

The aim of this study is to investigate if, in addition to the conventional sets of variables (socio-demographics, purchase history, etc.), kinship network based variables improve the predictive power of customer retention models. Results show that the predictive power of the churn model can indeed be improved by adding the social network ({SNA}-) based variables. Including network structure measures (i.e. degree, betweenness centrality and density) increase predictive accuracy, but contextual network based variables turn out to have the highest impact on discriminating churners from non-churners. For the majority of the latter type of network variables, the importance in the model is even higher than the individual level counterpart variable.},

Within a predictive modeling setting, such features could be highly informative as it might be useful to know that people live in the same village or pay with the same bank account number. Despite this notable and intuitive advantage, high-cardinality attributes are rarely used in predictive modeling. The main reason for this is that including these attributes by using traditional transformation methods is either impossible due to anonymization of the data (when using semantic grouping of the values) or will vastly increase the dimensionality of the data set (when using dummy encoding), thereby making it difficult or even impossible for most classification techniques to build prediction models. The main contributions of this work are (1) the introduction of several possible transformation functions coming from different domains and contexts, that allow the inclusion of high-cardinality features in predictive models. (2) Using a unique data set of a large energy company with more than 1 million customers, we show that adding such features indeed improves the predictive performance of the model significantly. Moreover, (3) we empirically demonstrate that having more data leads to better prediction models, which is not observed for “traditional” data. As such, we also contribute to the area of big data analytics.},

In the context of a Belgian retail financial service company, our first contribution is to redefine the notion of customer loyalty by considering it from a customer-centric viewpoint instead of a product-centric one. We hereby use the customer lifetime value ({CLV}) defined as the discounted value of future marginal earnings, based on the customer’s activity. Hence, a churner is defined as someone whose {CLV}, thus the related marginal profit, is decreasing. As a second contribution, the loss incurred by the {CLV} decrease is used to appraise the cost to misclassify a customer by introducing a new loss function. In the empirical study, we compare the accuracy of various classification techniques commonly used in the domain of churn prediction, including two cost-sensitive classifiers. Our final conclusion is that since profit is what really matters in a commercial environment, standard statistical accuracy measures for prediction need to be revised and a more profit oriented focus may be desirable.},

Therefore, in the first part of this paper, a novel, profit centric performance measure is developed, by calculating the maximum profit that can be generated by including the optimal fraction of customers with the highest predicted probabilities to attrite in a retention campaign. The novel measure selects the optimal model and fraction of customers to include, yielding a significant increase in profits compared to statistical measures. In the second part an extensive benchmarking experiment is conducted, evaluating various classification techniques applied on eleven real-life data sets from telecom operators worldwide by using both the profit centric and statistically based performance measures.

In recent literature, ensemble classifiers have demonstrated superior performance in a multitude of applications and data mining contests. However, due to an increased complexity they result in models that are often difficult to interpret. In this study, {GAMensPlus}, an ensemble classifier based upon generalized additive models ({GAMs}), in which both performance and interpretability are reconciled, is presented and evaluated in a context of churn prediction modeling. The recently proposed {GAMens}, based upon Bagging, the Random Subspace Method and semi-parametric {GAMs} as constituent classifiers, is extended to include two instruments for model interpretability: generalized feature importance scores, and bootstrap confidence bands for smoothing splines. In an experimental comparison on data sets of six real-life churn prediction projects, the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm over a set of well-known benchmark algorithms is demonstrated in terms of four evaluation metrics. Further, the ability of the technique to deliver valuable insight into the drivers of customer churn is illustrated in a case study on data from a European bank. Firstly, it is shown how the generalized feature importance scores allow the analyst to identify the relative importance of churn predictors in function of the criterion that is used to measure the quality of the model predictions. Secondly, the ability of {GAMensPlus} to identify nonlinear relationships between predictors and churn probabilities is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {This study examines the use of social network information for customer churn prediction. An alternative modeling approach using relational learning algorithms is developed to incorporate social network effects within a customer churn prediction setting, in order to handle large scale networks, a time dependent class label, and a skewed class distribution. An innovative approach to incorporate non-Markovian network effects within relational classifiers and a novel parallel modeling setup to combine a relational and non-relational classification model are introduced. The results of two real life case studies on large scale telco data sets are presented, containing both networked (call detail records) and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. A significant impact of social network effects, including non-Markovian effects, on the performance of a customer churn prediction model is found, and the parallel model setup is shown to boost the profits generated by a retention campaign.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the staying power of various churn prediction models. Staying power is defined as the predictive performance of a model in a number of periods after the estimation period. We examine two methods, logit models and classification trees, both with and without applying a bagging procedure. Bagging consists of averaging the results of multiple models that have each been estimated on a bootstrap sample from the original sample. We test the models using customer data of two firms from different industries, namely the internet service provider and insurance markets. The results show that the classification tree in combination with a bagging procedure outperforms the other three methods. It is shown that the ability to identify high risk customers of this model is similar for the in-period and one-period-ahead forecasts. However, for all methods the staying power is rather low, as the predictive performance deteriorates considerably within a few periods after the estimation period. This is due to the fact that both the parameter estimates change over time and the fact that the variables that are significant differ between periods. Our findings indicate that churn models should be adapted regularly. We provide a framework for database analysts to reconsider their methods used for churn modeling and to assess for how long they can use an estimated model.},

	abstract = {Multimedia on demand ({MOD}) is an interactive system that provides a number of value-added services in addition to traditional {TV} services, such as video on demand and interactive online learning. This opens a new marketing and managerial problem for the telecommunication industry to retain valuable {MOD} customers. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to develop customer churn prediction models, such as neural networks and decision trees in the domain of mobile telecommunication. However, much related work focuses on developing the prediction models per se. Few studies consider the pre-processing step during data mining whose aim is to filter out unrepresentative data or information. This paper presents the important processes of developing {MOD} customer churn prediction models by data mining techniques. They contain the pre-processing stage for selecting important variables by association rules, which have not been applied before, the model construction stage by neural networks ({NN}) and decision trees ({DT}), which are widely adapted in the literature, and four evaluation measures including prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, all of which have not been considered to examine the model performance. The source data are based on one telecommunication company providing the {MOD} services in Taiwan, and the experimental results show that using association rules allows the {DT} and {NN} models to provide better prediction performances over a chosen validation dataset. In particular, the {DT} model performs better than the {NN} model. Moreover, some useful and important rules in the {DT} model, which show the factors affecting a high proportion of customer churn, are also discussed for the marketing and managerial purpose.},

	abstract = {Uplift modeling has received increasing interest in both the business analytics research community and the industry as an improved paradigm for predictive analytics for data-driven operational decision-making. The literature, however, does not provide conclusive empirical evidence that uplift modeling outperforms predictive modeling. Case studies that directly compare both approaches are lacking, and the performance of predictive models and uplift models as reported in various experimental studies cannot be compared indirectly since different evaluation measures are used to assess their performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation metric called the maximum profit uplift ({MPU}) measure that allows assessing the performance in terms of the maximum potential profit that can be achieved by adopting an uplift model. This measure, developed for evaluating customer churn uplift models, extends the maximum profit measure for evaluating customer churn prediction models. While introducing the {MPU} measure, we describe the generally applicable liftup curve and liftup measure for evaluating uplift models as counterparts of the lift curve and lift measure that are broadly used to evaluate predictive models. These measures are subsequently applied to assess and compare the performance of customer churn prediction and uplift models in a case study that applies uplift modeling to customer retention in the financial industry. We observe that uplift models outperform predictive models and lead to improved profitability of retention campaigns.},
