      "<Page:5>  Research selected Decision Tree, Neural Network and K-means cluster as data mining techniques to build predictive models or segment customers . Churner is defined as a subscriber  who is voluntary to leave; non-churner  is the subscriber who is still using this operator’s service . We used latest six months’ transactions of each subscriber to  predict customers’ churn probability of the following month .\n",

Then we create a Decision Tree model in each cluster (see Approach 1 in Figure 3) This is to assess if the churn behaviors are different in different “Value-Loyalty’s” segments .

      "<Page:1>  The results provide evidence that word of mouth has a considerable impact on customers’ churn decisions and also on the purchase decisions, leading to a 19.5% and 8.4% increase in sensitivity of pre-dictive models . The results show that information on the churn of network neigh-bors has a significant positive impact on the predictive accuracy and in particular the sensitivity of churn models .\n",
      "<Page:2>  The churn rate refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a service pro-uablyvider during a given time period . It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or bet-ter offers from the competition, or reasons related to the customer life cycle . The accuracy of churn prediction models matters and that just using one method rather than another  can easily amount to changes in profit in the hundreds of thousands of dollars .\n",
      "<Page:3>  We use customers’ anonymized call detail records as a way of modeling WOM . In contrast to traditional classification methods, we take into account the infor-heticalmation about who a customer calls – i.e., a customer’s neighbors in the communication graph derived  from the call detail record data . We interpret these graphs as social networks, which can be stored in a relational data model .\n",
      "<Page:4>  Statistical relational learning is a relatively young field and there is still only limited empirical evidence on the performance of respective learners . There are two fundamentally different approaches to analyzing multi-relational data . Markov logic networks (MLNs) have recently been suggested as a significant step forward in this field .\n",
      "<Page:5>  The prediction of customers’ churn or buying decisions is important to marketers . In this paper, we analyze whether WOM has an impact on customer behavior or not . The analysis is based on anonymized calling data from a telecom provider . We found the churn behavior of a customer’s neighbor has a significant positive impact on predictive accuracy of churn models .\n",
      "<Page:6>  Churn management is to determine the reasons for churn and to predict the potential churners . In the following section we discuss churn and the related literature on churn and WOM literature . There are different strands of literature that are relevant to this paper . There is also a relation between customer tenure and the tendency of customers to engage in word of mouth .\n",
      "<Page:7>  A huge body of literature has emerged on the analysis of social networks . We focus on post-paid customers, which allows us to leverage information about potential churners . The authors study the evolution of churners in an operator’s network of pre-paid subscribers and the pro-verselypensity of a subscriber to churn out of a service provider's network depending on the number of ties .\n",
      "<Page:8>  Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) has been an emerging research topic in the data mining community in recent years . We understand propositionalization as a transformation of multi-relational learning prob-lems into attribute-value representations . We discuss this approach in more detail in the next section .\n",
      "<Page:9>  ILP has traditionally dealt with multi-relational data . ILP tools can be applied directly to multi-referred data to find first-order rules from relational data . Markov logic networks (MLNs) have become very popular in statistical relational learning recently . In our analysis, we use Alchemy (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/), an open source software tool for learning MLNs from data .\n",
      "<Page:10>  There are two main approaches to propositionalization in the literature, logic-oriented and database-oriented literature . Business databases present different challenges than those found in the classical showcase areas of ILP and logic-based propositionalizations . Relational databases are usually structurally simpler .\n",
      "<Page:11>  A churner is defined as a customer who gives notice about their intent to cancel the contract and does not re-evaluate his decision by extending his contract at some point afterwards . A non-churner (or negative) is a  customer who does not give notice at any time . In our data, 6,800 customers told the phone provider that they wanted to cancel their contract (notification) Roughly 1,000 revoked their decision afterwards by extending their contracts .\n",
      "<Page:12>  Figure 1 (a) and (b) shows a visualization of connections be-tween positives and customers with a game download in the test data set . The graphs could suggest that game downloading is contagious because there are many connections between persons downloading                 games, while this is less so in the case of churn customers .\n",
      "<Page:13>  We split the set of 2,645 customers in training and test datasets such that it was stratified with re-naissancespect to the number of positives and edge counts . Training and test data contained 1325 and 1320 custom-ishlyers, respectively . Positives were assigned according to their notification date; customers who notified before July 1, 2008 were assigned to the training data .\n",
      "<Page:14>  Among the selected 3,000 customers there were 7,950 edges – 1,865 among positives, 2,127 among negatives, and 3,950 between both groups . From the 70 available customer attributes we selected the 32 best ones based on information gain with respect to the target variable .\n",
      "<Page:15>  MLN, classification is the problem of inferring the truth value of C(x,v) for all x and v of interest . In relational learning problems, dependencies between objects can be represented by relational predicates . In our example, churn of customer x would be considered independent of the churn of other custom-crafteders . We model an influence relationship between connected customers’ urchurn behavior saying that customer x is likely to churn if customer x did already .\n",
      "<Page:16>  A fundamental problem with database-oriented propositionalization has been referred to as degree disparity [25]. It describes the systematic variation in the distribution of the degree                 with respect to the target variable . A customer with a large number of neighbors would also have more churn neighbors than a customer with just a few neighbors . The difference among MLN settings is again the way in which connec-propriitionalization approaches are different .\n",
      "<Page:17>  The resulting models for the logistic regression (benchmark) as well as for all propositionalization settings showed that three groups of customer attributes were especially important . In the logit model, all but one variable about a customer’s utilized products were highly significant (<0.001) In contrast, for propositionalized settings T2.1-to-T2.4 we found only five significant customer attributes in the respective logit models .\n",
      "<Page:18>  Propositionalization settings with churn aggregates (T2.1 to T2.4) dominate all other settings,  apologetic and MLN settings . Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives that are cor-rectly recognized as true positives . Specificity measures proportion of false positives correctly recognized as false positives . Table 1 presents the results for churn prediction .\n",
      "<Page:19>  The best propositionalization approach outperforms the best MLN model . Figure 2 shows the ROC curve of the three MLN settings and the logistic regression . The ROC is based on the proportion of true positives (TPR) vs. false positives (FPR) for every possible cutoff .\n",
      "<Page:20>  Propositionalization with churn rate aggregates (T2.1 to T2.4) has the highest overall sensitivity and accuracy, but MLNs yield comparable results for smaller samples . Both propositionalization and MLN clearly outperform the baseline model .\n",
      "<Page:21>  We were interested in ways how information about neighbors can help predict alternative target variables . We looked at game download, since people with game downloads appear to be well connected . Game download showed exceptionally many connections among the positives, suggesting that  there might also be an influence of customers on each other .\n",
      "<Page:22>  The overall accuracy and precision were again highest for the propositionalization settings T2.1 to T.2.4 and the three MLN settings T3.1 . All nine settings performed  better than the benchmark logistic regression, except for one attribute about the duration of the present contract .\n"

      "<Page:2>  From an algorithm-based perspective, CRM has evolved from using RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) models, to more recent advanced techniques such as random forests (Larivière & Van den Poel, 2005), neural networks (Zahavi & Levin, 1997) and support vector machines (Shin & Cho, 2006) The data and algorithm dimensions are very important, but they constitute only two of three components of the modeling problem . The third component, the time window, remains thus far under-researched (see fig. 1)\n",
      "<Page:3>  We provide a formalization of different types of windows . A window type can be defined by the variability of the length of the window: constant (C) or variable (V) Given the three time windows in one configuration, the predictors period, the operational period and the response period, there are theoretically 8 possible configurations .\n",
      "<Page:4>  We analyze the entire customer database of a newspaper company . The churn rate for the estimation and validation is respectively 11.15% and 11.47% . Churn prediction involves predicting whether  the customer will or not renew his or her subscription in the four-week period following the end of the subscription . The performance of the two techniques is very similar and depends on a multitude of factors such as the normality of the data .\n",
      "<Page:5>  Logistic regression and classification trees are widely used by practitioners and academics . Bagging is a simple approach to increase the predictive performance of classification techniques . We used CHAID (Chi-squared automatic interaction detection) and not CART (Breiman,  Friedman, Olshen & Stone, 1984) as the method of classication tree construction .\n",

In addition to RFM variables, length of relationship (LOR) also is a top predictor . Table 1 provides an overview of the included variables in this study .\n",

Figure 2 represents an example such as the picture sets we used (a woman’s facial expressions)\n",
      "<Page:10>  AUC is argued to be an objective criterion for classifier performance by several authors . We use AUC instead of accuracy (Percentage of correctly classified, PCC) because AUC,  in contrast to PCC, is the insensitive to the cut-off value of the ‘a posteriori’ prob-abilities . AUC ranges from .5, if the predictions are not better than random, to 1, if the model predicts the behavior perfectly .\n",

We follow the recommendation of (Demšar, 2006) to use the Wilcox signed rank test . Figure 3 presents the added value per data type . Results indicate that the addi-generation of the operational data accounts for the biggest increase in AUC .\n",
      "<Page:12>  When only administrative data is analyzed pictorials add 0.9% to the predictive performance . When all data are modeled pictorial stimulus- choice data adds 0.1% .

      "<Page:6>  The issue of customer retention/churn gained traction in the late 1990s and early 2000s . Marketing researchers proposed a variety of methods to predict which customers are at the highest risk of churning . The rationale behind such a practice is straightforward: Targeting customers with the highest propensity to churn enables ﬁrms to focus their eﬀorts on customers who are truly at risk . This enables them to potentially save money that would be wasted in providing incentives to customers who would have stayed regardless .\n",
      "<Page:7>  Two streams of work have investigated approaches that go beyond targeting those at the highest risk of churning . The cost of misclassifying customers largely depends on the proﬁtability of each customer . The second approach, mainly driven by practitioners, has recognized the need to exam-eanine the incremental eﬀect of the ﬁrm’s actions rather than merely the behavior incurred by the customer .\n",
      "<Page:8>  The ﬁrm is faced with the problem of deciding which customers should be targeted in the next retention campaign . The most common approach in practice is to target the customers who are at the highest risk of churning . In this paper we argue that such a targeting rule is not necessarily optimal . We propose an approach for proactive churn management that overcomes this limitation .\n",
      "<Page:9>  We argue that retention managers should target their retention eﬀorts to customers with highest LIFT . LIFT is the probability that the customer will churn if she is targeted, 0 otherwise . Blattberg et al.

      "<Page:13>  We encourage ﬁrms to employ A/B testing (or small-scale pilots) not only to evaluate marketing actions but also to identify customer targets . We focus on the incremental eﬀect of the campaign rather than on the propensity to churn . The proposed approach not only generalizes existing practices for proactive churn management .\n",
      "<Page:14>  We use the experimental set-up to simulate what the impact of these retention campaigns would be had they implemented our approach instead of the standard practice .

      "<Page:15>  Using the observed data from customers in the calibration sample, we estimate a hetero-glyous treatment eﬀect model using churn as a dependent variable . This model will be used to predict the customers’ sensitivity to the marketing intervention . Step 2: Estimate a model for incremental churn (i.e., LIFT model) Using the risk scoring model estimated in Step 3, we predict risk of churning for each customer in the validation sample .\n",
      "<Page:16>  Using the incremental churn model estimated in Step 2, we predict, for each customer in the validation sample, the following quantities: The probability of churn if not targeted, P(Y = 1|T = 0,X = x ) The probability if targeted, deﬁned as P(y = 1 |T = 1, X = x) P(J = 1) is the expected incremental eﬀect of the campaign .

      "<Page:24>  Figure 3 shows the magnitude of the treatment eﬀects, TE and TE for each of the empirical applications .

      "<Page:25>  Figure 4depicts the impact of the retention campaign if targeting based on RISK or LIFT . The impact of targeting customers based on LIFT decreases as the percentage of customers being targeted increases . The LIFT approach selects the “best” (i.e., more sensitive) customers, therefore the eﬀectiveness of the campaign should decrease .\n",
      "<Page:26>  The company would have increased churn by 4.4 percentage points if targeting the 40% of customers with highest risk of churning (top RISK) and those that are most sensitive to the retention intervention (top LIFT) Both methods would give similar eﬀectiveness if the company decided to target most customers .\n",
      "<Page:27>  Relationship between RISK and LIFT metrics is rather weak . In Study 1, among the 10% of customers with highest RISK, only 16% of them also belong to the top 10% LIFT group . Figure 2c shows that in Study 2, the level of overlap between the two metrics is not only weak but negative .\n",
      "<Page:28>  Study 2 looked at relationship between the variables ‘Tenure’ and ‘Last recharge’ with RISK and LIFT . The variable ‘Data volume’ reveals an interesting pattern. It suggests that if the company decided to send a retention incentive to customers with low data consumption, such a campaign would likely increase churn .\n",
      "<Page:29>  Targeting based on LIFT is more effective at reducing customer churn than targeting on the basis of RISK . The same retention campaign would result in a further reduction of 4.1 and 8.7 percentage points in churn rate . This result is consistent across both studies representing two business settings (wireless/telecom and special-interest organization)\n",
      "<Page:30>  The magnitude of the impact of the campaign does not depend on where each customer is relocated . The lack of relationship between RISK and LIFT is not due to the selection of customers eligible for the research . Future research should investigate these relationships in the interest of better designing incentives for retention campaigns .\n",
      "<Page:31>  Proactive churn management programs have been mainly applied to contractual settings (e.g., telecommu-nications, ﬁnancial services, utilities, memberships) Noncontractual settings can also leverage our proposed approach to select targets in their marketing campaigns .\n",
      "<Page:32>  It is important to note that churn (or customer retention) is only one measure of interestin the customer relationship . In many business contexts, other behaviors (e.g., consump-tion) are also important determinants of the value of a customer . In some settings, some customers will be more valuable than others even if they all had the same churn propensity .\n",
      "<Page:33>  The real challenge of estimating Value-LIFT is that one needs a very long time horizon to estimate the impact of the marketing intervention . In order to simplify the expression of CLV, most past work in marketing has assumed constant margins and retention probabilities . However, the main purpose of a marketing campaignistoalter theprobability thatacustomer will renew, making assumption about constant retention rates problematic .\n",
      "<Page:34>  Proactive churn management programs should not necessarily be targeted to customers who are at the highest risk of churning . Instead, they should target only customers whose propensity to churn will decrease in response to the intervention . We show that the same campaign would reduce churn by an additional 4.1 and 8.7 percentage points relative to the standard practice of targeting customers at highest risk .\n",
      "<Page:35>  From our research: (1) the company observes customer behavior at the individual level, and (2) the ﬁrm is capable to interact with customers in a one-on-one basis (i.e., they can run individually-targeted campaigns) Examples of these business contexts include credit card companies, softwareproviders, onlineandoﬄinesubscriptions and leisure memberships .\n",
      "<Page:36>  An ideal scenario would be to analyze the case of the same company testing di-erentincentives . Longer assessment-periods would allow the researcher to measure long-term e-centric incentives and potentially identify the best targeting rules for optimizing out-costs . We anticipate/speculate that the proposed approach is beneﬁcial regardless of the churn rate .\n",
      "<Page:37>  An optimal size for a retention pilot would be small, but a smaller sample size might be better . How stable (over time) is the heterogeneity in sensitivity to the retention action? We hope that future research will address these and other related issues . There are notobvious reasons why the relationship between the correlation and the sensitivity of the intervention would change over time, it would useful to empirically investigate this question .\n",

      "<Page:12>  Using available training data, SVM model is first developed under 10-FCV and support vectors are extracted for each fold . The distance between the support vectors and training  instances is then calculated before generating the extra instances . 500 and 1,000 extra data instances are generated for empirical analysis in the present study .\n",

      "<Page:1>  Keivan Kianmehr* and Reda Alhajj have published over 30 papers in prestigious venues . Identifying calling communities can be used to determine a particular customer’s value according to the general pattern of behaviour of the community that the customer belongs to . This helps in resolving issues  like predicting terrorist groups .\n",
      "<Page:2>  Reda Alhajj is a Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada . He has published over 280 papers . His research focuses on machine learning techniques, social networks, XML, data mining  methods and bioinformatics . Identifying social communities is an emerging research area that has already attracted the attention of several research groups .\n",
      "<Page:3>  A fuzzy prediction model for calling communities has been proposed by Yang et al. It is a new algorithm, recently proposed, to mine signed social networks where both  positive  within-group  relations  and negative  negative  relationships are dense . FEC considers both the sign and the density of relations as the  ‘clustering’ attributes, making it effective  for  not  only  signed networks  but  also  conventional social networks including only positive relations . FEC adopts an ipientagent-based heuristic that makes the algorithm efficient and capable of giving nearly optimal solutions .\n",
      "<Page:4>  The ability to dynamically classify and predict customers’ calling patterns according to their calling patterns obtained from CDR data has attracted considerable attention in the research community . Data mining is applied in this area to perform two  major tasks: predicting whether a particular customer will churn and when this will happen . This helps the effective targeted marketing design which is significantly important for increasing profitability in the telecommunication industry .\n",
      "<Page:5>  The Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a statistical-based learning approach has been used to build the classifier model . A fuzzy genetic algorithm has been also applied for the classification task . Fuzziness is attractive because it facilitates the possibility of having partial membership in a given group .\n",
      "<Page:6>  The CDR data used in this work was given by a telecommunication company providing wireless services . The majority of the destination numbers are outside of the service provider’s network . The other type of phone numbers are those in the service providers’ network, and each of them corresponds to a customer . The data preprocessing, clustering, and classifier model is able to assign a new customer to one community .\n",
      "<Page:7>  The given data set consists of 55 000 calling records of 2000 subscribers . Calls with very low duration (less than 5 sec) are assumed to have no effect on identifying the subscriber’s neighbours and are ignored . Clustering refers to the process of partitioning a set of data points into a meaningful sub-classes called clusters .\n",
      "<Page:8>  K. Kianmehr and R. Alhajj used the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to discover calling communities . The algorithm is a bottom up clustering approach that investigates grouping in the given data by creating a cluster tree according to a particular distance ggiemeasure . The output is a tree that represents a multi-level hierarchy, where clusters at one level are grouped together to form clusters at the next higher level .\n",
      "<Page:9>  The MATLAB Statistics Toolbox has been used for conducting the                 hierarchical clustering . The basic procedure to perform hierarchical clustering in our model is as follows: Find the similarity and dissimilarity (including both first and second order distances) of customers in the CDR data .\n",
      "<Page:10>  The first approach is SVM from the family of statistical-based learning algorithms . The goal of SVM is to construct a separating hyperplane that is maximally distant from different classes of the training data . Then, a set of feature vectors, each of which corresponds to a specific customer, is used as the training set for the classification algorithm .\n",
      "<Page:11> erro\n",
      "<Page:12>  Genetic algorithms have been successfully used for the search and optimisation of problems . John Holland pioneered genetic algorithms as initiated with cellular automata . A genetic algorithm uses an evolutionary approach to find optimal solutions . The population evolves at every generation by using a Darwinian approach . Algorithm 1 provides pseudo code  for a simple simple genetic algorithm . Two primary parameters in genetic algorithm are population size and termination criteria .\n",
      "<Page:13>  A fuzzy prediction model for calling communities is based on a model of genetic evolution . The main steps in the algorithm are: Initialise population, evaluate fitness of individuals in population, select parents and mate for reproduction . Genes in the chromosome may change stochastically to generate offspring with sexual crossover and mutation .\n",
      "<Page:14>  Genetic algorithms have shown to be a powerful tool for performing:  generation and optimisation of fuzzy rule-base  algorithms and tuning of membership functions . In a fuzzy  rule-based  system, fuzzy  if-then  rules  for an  n-dimensional pattern are defined as follows (Ishibuchi et al., 1999):  If x  is A  and … and x is A then  then Class C with CF,   (6) If x x is  A   and    then  x is a  then . x  then x is . A  single point crossover example (see online version for colours)\n",
      "<Page:15>  In this study, a small number of fuzzy if-then rules have been randomly generated . The number of combinations of the antecedent fuzzy sets is 6n, which is very large in the case of high-dimensional problems . The meaning of each linguistic value is specified by a triangular membership function on the unit interval [0,1]. ‘don’t care’ has been handled by a special membership function with the following membership function .\n",
      "<Page:16>  The genetic algorithm has been set to use the uniform crossover, where each substring is handled as a block . It does not involve the adjustment of certainty grade functions or certainty grade . We have followed the implementation of Pittsburgh approach as it is faster compared to Michigan . The fitness of the rule set S is measured as:  NCP(S) is the number of correctly classified training patterns .\n",
      "<Page:17>  Using CDR data, a cluster tree has been built . The data is randomly divided into 5 disjoint groups . The first group is set aside for testing and the other four are put together for model building . The mean of the five independent error rate predictions is used as the error rate for the final model . We believe indirect calling patterns will provide more useful information compared with direct calling patterns .\n",
      "<Page:18>  Figure 6 and Table 1 show how the clustering algorithm was evaluated with K being the number of clusters created from the cluster tree . The classification algorithm used for evaluating clusters is SVM . The reason that fuzzy genetic classifier has not been used  is because of its running time .\n",
      "<Page:19>  SVM has an average overall accuracy of 98.5%, while fuzzy genetic classifier has an accuracy of 82.5% . SVM outperforms the fuzzy genetic algorithm by almost 13% . Pittsburgh approach is not directly based on fuzzy if-then rules but on fuzzy genetic operations in Pittsburgh approach . The running time of SVM classifier was significantly less than fuzzy genetic .\n",
      "<Page:20>  The fuzzy if-then rules in the final classifier model are divided into n subsets, where n is the number of distinct available classes (communities) For a particular customer,  every subset is examined to see whether there is any compatible rule with the feature  that represents the customer calling pattern . If there exists, such a rule is able to assign the ipient customer to the class of the subset under test . The certainty factor of the  compatible rule will then represent the degree of membership of this customer to its identified class (community)\n",
