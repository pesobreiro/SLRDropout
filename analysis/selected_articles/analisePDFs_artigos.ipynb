      "<Page:2>  The churn rate refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a service pro-uablyvider during a given time period . It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or bet-ter offers from the competition, or reasons related to the customer life cycle . The accuracy of churn prediction models matters and that just using one method rather than another  can easily amount to changes in profit in the hundreds of thousands of dollars .\n",

In contrast to traditional classification methods, we take into account the infor-heticalmation about who a customer calls – i.e., a customer’s neighbors in the communication graph derived  from the call detail record data . We interpret these graphs as social networks, which can be stored in a relational data model .\n",

In the following section we discuss churn and the related literature on churn and WOM literature . There are different strands of literature that are relevant to this paper . There is also a relation between customer tenure and the tendency of customers to engage in word of mouth .\n",

      "<Page:8>  Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) has been an emerging research topic in the data mining community in recent years .

In our analysis, we use Alchemy (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/), an open source software tool for learning MLNs from data .\n",
      "<Page:10>  There are two main approaches to propositionalization in the literature, logic-oriented and database-oriented literature . Business databases present different challenges than those found in the classical showcase areas of ILP and logic-based propositionalizations . Relational databases are usually structurally simpler .\n",
      "<Page:11>  A churner is defined as a customer who gives notice about their intent to cancel the contract and does not re-evaluate his decision by extending his contract at some point afterwards . A non-churner (or negative) is a  customer who does not give notice at any time . In our data, 6,800 customers told the phone provider that they wanted to cancel their contract (notification) Roughly 1,000 revoked their decision afterwards by extending their contracts .\n",
      "<Page:12>  Figure 1 (a) and (b) shows a visualization of connections be-tween positives and customers with a game download in the test data set . The graphs could suggest that game downloading is contagious because there are many connections between persons downloading                 games, while this is less so in the case of churn customers .\n",
      "<Page:13>  We split the set of 2,645 customers in training and test datasets such that it was stratified with re-naissancespect to the number of positives and edge counts . Training and test data contained 1325 and 1320 custom-ishlyers, respectively . Positives were assigned according to their notification date; customers who notified before July 1, 2008 were assigned to the training data .\n",
      "<Page:14>  Among the selected 3,000 customers there were 7,950 edges – 1,865 among positives, 2,127 among negatives, and 3,950 between both groups . From the 70 available customer attributes we selected the 32 best ones based on information gain with respect to the target variable .\n",
      "<Page:15>  MLN, classification is the problem of inferring the truth value of C(x,v) for all x and v of interest . In relational learning problems, dependencies between objects can be represented by relational predicates . In our example, churn of customer x would be considered independent of the churn of other custom-crafteders . We model an influence relationship between connected customers’ urchurn behavior saying that customer x is likely to churn if customer x did already .\n",
      "<Page:16>  A fundamental problem with database-oriented propositionalization has been referred to as degree disparity [25]. It describes the systematic variation in the distribution of the degree                 with respect to the target variable . A customer with a large number of neighbors would also have more churn neighbors than a customer with just a few neighbors . The difference among MLN settings is again the way in which connec-propriitionalization approaches are different .\n",
      "<Page:17>  The resulting models for the logistic regression (benchmark) as well as for all propositionalization settings showed that three groups of customer attributes were especially important . In the logit model, all but one variable about a customer’s utilized products were highly significant (<0.001) In contrast, for propositionalized settings T2.1-to-T2.4 we found only five significant customer attributes in the respective logit models .\n",
      "<Page:18>  Propositionalization settings with churn aggregates (T2.1 to T2.4) dominate all other settings,  apologetic and MLN settings . Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives that are cor-rectly recognized as true positives . Specificity measures proportion of false positives correctly recognized as false positives . Table 1 presents the results for churn prediction .\n",
      "<Page:19>  The best propositionalization approach outperforms the best MLN model . Figure 2 shows the ROC curve of the three MLN settings and the logistic regression . The ROC is based on the proportion of true positives (TPR) vs. false positives (FPR) for every possible cutoff .\n",
      "<Page:20>  Propositionalization with churn rate aggregates (T2.1 to T2.4) has the highest overall sensitivity and accuracy, but MLNs yield comparable results for smaller samples . Both propositionalization and MLN clearly outperform the baseline model .\n",
      "<Page:21>  We were interested in ways how information about neighbors can help predict alternative target variables . We looked at game download, since people with game downloads appear to be well connected . Game download showed exceptionally many connections among the positives, suggesting that  there might also be an influence of customers on each other .\n",
      "<Page:22>  The overall accuracy and precision were again highest for the propositionalization settings T2.1 to T.2.4 and the three MLN settings T3.1 . All nine settings performed  better than the benchmark logistic regression, except for one attribute about the duration of the present contract .\n"

Support Vector Machines: This ML method, based on statistical learning theory, is able to optimally separate two class of objects (e.g., churners and retained customers) through the generation of a multivariate maximally separating hyperplane .

The third component, the time window, remains thus far under-researched (see fig. 1)\n",
      "<Page:3>  We provide a formalization of different types of windows .

      "<Page:4>  We analyze the entire customer database of a newspaper company . The churn rate for the estimation and validation is respectively 11.15% and 11.47% . Churn prediction involves predicting whether  the customer will or not renew his or her subscription in the four-week period following the end of the subscription . The performance of the two techniques is very similar and depends on a multitude of factors such as the normality of the data .\n",
      "<Page:5>  Logistic regression and classification trees are widely used by practitioners and academics . Bagging is a simple approach to increase the predictive performance of classification techniques . We used CHAID (Chi-squared automatic interaction detection) and not CART (Breiman,  Friedman, Olshen & Stone, 1984) as the method of classication tree construction .\n",

      "<Page:1>  The purpose of this paper is to determine the added value of pictorial stimulus-choice data in customer churn prediction . The practical implication is that companies should start mining pictorial data from social media sites (e.g. Pinterest) or use pictures instead of verbal scales in surveys .\n",
      "<Page:2>  Even small increases in retention can have substantial impact on a company’s results (Gupta,  Lehmann, &  Stuart, 2004) Even an increase of 1% in retention in a company can have a dramatic influence on contributions . The internal transactional database is considered the baseline for database enhancement because it contains the  top predictors in extant database marketing modeling: recency, frequency and  monetary value .\n",
      "<Page:3>  Pictures contain a massive amount of information and user actions could potentially reveal part of that information . Social media platforms and the rise of picture centered social networks (e.g., Pinterest) new opportunities for data augmentation are created in the realm of pic-torial content . The study aims to assess the added value of picorial stimulus choice data to customer churn prediction over and above traditional customer data .\n",
      "<Page:4>  Traditional surveys are too long asking the re-spondent too much of his/her time . Social barriers, language barriers and memory-based barriers can be overcome . Pictures alleviate these problems in that they function as an enabling technique . Picture association is a task in which the respondent is asked to choose a picture or image out of multiple possibilities as re-request to a specific question .\n",
      "<Page:5>  An alternative response method (pictures instead of scales) can be conceived of as being the source of multiple advantages and would there-ishlyfore be an attractive means of data augmentation . The study aims to fill this gap in literature by evaluating the added value of  pictorial stimulus-choice data in customer intelligence over and above the tradi-centric data sources discussed above .\n",

Survey data can be conceived of as resulting from a company-initiated feedback process . Mindset variables (e.g., purchase intentions, commitment, product rec-ommendations) are impossible to collect from internal processes .\n",
      "<Page:9>  We used Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) to create the churn model because of  multiple reasons . We opted for an ad-hoc approach here (an online survey) while companies could go online and mine social network data . Figure 2 represents an example such as the picture sets we used (a woman’s facial expressions)\n",
      "<Page:10>  AUC is argued to be an objective criterion for classifier performance by several authors . We use AUC instead of accuracy (Percentage of correctly classified, PCC) because AUC,  in contrast to PCC, is the insensitive to the cut-off value of the ‘a posteriori’ prob-abilities . AUC ranges from .5, if the predictions are not better than random, to 1, if the model predicts the behavior perfectly .\n",

We follow the recommendation of (Demšar, 2006) to use the Wilcox signed rank test . Figure 3 presents the added value per data type . Results indicate that the addi-generation of the operational data accounts for the biggest increase in AUC .\n",
      "<Page:12>  When only administrative data is analyzed pictorials add 0.9% to the predictive performance . When all data are modeled pictorial stimulus- choice data adds 0.1% .

We also include variables often used in credit scoring, but not (often) used in churn prediction . Other variables that can be added to the model include detailed credit bureau reports (e.g., Overstreet and Bradley, 1994)\n",
      "<Page:6>  Previous bad-payment behavior is more important in the financial churn prediction model than in the commercial churn predictions model . Different types of interventions can have different impacts on customers depending on their characteristics (e.g., De Wulf et al. 2001) Targeting financial defection-prone customers worsens customer retention . Targeting with relationship-oriented marketing interventions will hence improve retention .\n",
      "<Page:7>  Breiman (2001) introduced a solution to the previously mentioned problem: Random Forests . This technique uses a subset of m randomly chosen predictors to grow each tree on a bootstrap sample of the training data . After a large number of trees is generated, each tree votes for the  most popular class . By aggregating these votes over the different trees, each case is predicted a class label .\n",
      "<Page:8>  The aim of the definition is to quantify the instantaneous risk that the event will occur at time t . The Kaplan-Meier estimator (also known as the Product Limit Estimator) provides an estimate of the survival function from life-time data (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) In customer churn prediction, one measures the length of  time customers remain with the company .\n",
      "<Page:9>  At this European pay-TV company, all customers have a 12-month subscription . Cancelling within that period is not allowed, nor is prematurely reporting that a subscription will not be renewed . In almost all cases, this is due to bad payment behavior: a customer cannot or does not want to pay his subscription any more .\n",
      "<Page:10>  Different subsets of the training set will be used while modeling financial churn . This is done to investigate the effects of leaving some customers out of the data set, on the predictive power of the model . Data is extracted for this study from the data warehouse of the pay-TV company . The static model had over 100,000 observations, of whom we collected 171 independent variables .\n",
      "<Page:11>  The survival curve of the customers of the pay-TV company (see Figure 3) clearly confirms the subscription renewal process . After one year, a huge drop can be noticed in the survival curve . Commercial churners do not churn during their one-year subscription; they do it at the end of their subscription .\n",
      "<Page:12>  The biggest part of commercial churn happens after one year of subscription: almost 20% of the customers leave at that point . Financial churners leave at any point in their relationship with the company . The curve decreases less and less, meaning that a customer is more at risk in the first few years of subscription .\n",
