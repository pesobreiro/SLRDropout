	abstract = {Churn prediction is the practice of assigning a probability to the event of a customer ending his contract with a service provider. Traditional data mining approaches to churn prediction in telecommunications industry are based on detecting patterns from customer contractual information, traffic related data, bills and payments, CRM data and customer service logs. The study presented in this paper has employed various machine learning approaches and assessed their performances using the data of a European mobile operator. The feature importance rankings which were used for feature selection yielded also some initial guidelines for acting on churn prevention in practice.},

	url = {https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1101635},
	abstract = {Fierce competition in many industries causes switching behavior of customers. Because foregone profits of defected customers are significant, an increase of the retention rate can be very profitable. In this paper, we focus on the treatment of companies' most promising current customers in a non-contractual setting. We build a model in order to predict churn behavior of top clients who will (partially) defect in the near future. We applied the following classification techniques: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, C4.5, neural networks and Naive Bayes. Their performance is quantified by the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The experiments were carried out on a real life data set obtained by a Belgian retailer. The article contributes in many ways. The results show that past customer behavior has predictive power to indicate future partial defection. This finding is from a companies' point of view even more important than being able to define total defectors, which was until now the traditional goal in attrition research. It was found that neural networks performed better than the other classification techniques in terms of both classification accuracy and AUROC. Although the performance benefits are sometimes small in absolute terms, they are statistically significant and relevant from a marketing perspective. Finally it was found that the number of past shop visits and the time between past shop incidences are amongst the most predictive inputs for the problem at hand.},
