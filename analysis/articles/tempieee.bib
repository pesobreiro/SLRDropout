Customer churn prediction is a well known area in Machine Learning research. Many companies, however, face a data science skills gap when trying to translate this research onto their own datasets and IT infrastructure. In this paper we present a series of experiments that aim to predict customer behaviour, in order to increase gym utilisation and customer retention. We use two off-the-shelf machine learning platforms, so that we can evaluate whether these platforms, used by non ML experts, can help companies improve their services.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently among the most commonly used machine learning methods in content understanding such as computer vision and natural language understanding (NLU). One of the best characteristics of these methods is their modular design - the ability to change the connectivity patterns of layers, try different activation functions, inject different statistical approaches such as normalization and dropout in the network, and many other actions - in every aspect of deep learning networks. While the majority of deep learning applications simply use cross-entropy, L1, and L2 losses, subjective loss function can actually result in impressive performance improvement. In addition, architecting the last layer of DNNs - referred to as the prediction layer - according to the needs of the application increases the discriminative power of the DNNs. This paper aims to investigate how particular choices of loss functions and prediction layer architecture affect deep neural networks and their learning dynamics, as well as the robustness of various effects. Furthermore a real-life application to measure customer loyalty called Deep Net Promoter Score (DeepNPS) from online product reviews is also proposed. The results are promising for learning more latent features and matching the customer feedback with the NPS score.},

Particularly, microblog as new social media needs more attention. Most of current studies are usually static descriptions or explanations of what already has happened. Limited study has been conducted focusing on SNS users and analysing their behaviors dynamically. In this paper, we firstly segment microblog users based on the recency and frequency of tweet and retweet behavior, then use probability models such as Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD to predict customer lifetime vitality. Our results showed that both Pareto/NBD model and BG/NBD model showed effective ability to fit and predict SNS users' usage behavior on microblog website. Tweet behaviors of sustainably active user base are more suitable for the probability models. Managerial implications of the two models should be highlighted as well. Interaction rate and dropout rate can be considered as the vitality index of the whole user base measuring how active users are and how likely a user is active. Managerial questions such as how active the users are in this platform now and how active the users will be in the future can be answered by applying those models.},

  pages = {215-220},
  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have emerged as a viable solution for text classification, including aspect extraction. Yet the existing state-of-the-art CNN architectures used in aspect extraction do not incorporate improvements (e.g. non-static CNN, multi-kernel convolution layers, and dropout regularization) that have been identified as beneficial for general text classification tasks. In this research, we present an improved CNN architecture with these enhancements for aspect extraction. Our modifications to the basic CNN model improve feature extraction of the convolutional layer, while allowing the dense layers to represent complex non-linear relationships between selected features and the output layer. Furthermore, we show that using non-static CNN instead of static CNN further fine-tunes the word embedding features for the specific domain of customer reviews in the absence of domain-specific corpora to train word2Vec models. We show that using Skip-gram trained word2vec models opposed to Continuous bag of word (CBOW) architecture improves the quality of word2vec embedding features for aspect extraction and text classification tasks. This new CNN model and baseline CNN are evaluated using SemEval-2016 Task 5 Restaurant and Laptop domain datasets. Our CNN model shows significant improvements over the baseline CNN model for aspect extraction from customer reviews for both restaurant and laptop domains. It also outperforms the currently available state-of-the-art systems for restaurant domain.},

In order to discriminate voltage variation from flicker in real time, this paper propose a virtual instrumentation system to implement a integrated algorithm which can complete the measurements of both events.

The analysis of the influential factors offers practitioners the means to identify problems, as well as, the chance to prioritize the appropriate measures for improvement, based on expected performance and anticipated cost. Teaching instructors, on the other hand, can differentiate their teaching according to students' perceptions. In the present work, an adapted version of the Course Experience Questionnaire was used to measure students' satisfaction. The 36-item scale, widely used in tertiary education for course assessment, examines a variety of factors along with total satisfaction. Utilizing importance-performance analysis the strengths and the weaknesses of the course were highlighted. The methodology proposed, offers educators a tool to identify the critical factors that affect students' satisfaction, and prioritize necessary interventions for the improvement of course performance.},

To cope with the challenges, fog computing is proposed, which is good at handling the real-time tasks but the service price can be correspondingly more expensive. In order to harvest more profits and get more users, the companies that offer cloud services also carry out the reservation selling strategy, whose price is relatively cheaper. For the purpose of minimizing the cost of using cloud services, this paper proposes a fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) based method to predict the demand of cloud resources. Besides the utilization of fuzzy logic, in the phase of network training, the back-propagation algorithm, adaptively varied learning rate and the dropout strategy are also employed. According to the network predictions, the customers are able to decide how many resources to reserve so as to minimize their expenses most. Simulation results based on the real data sets from Carnegie Mellon University show that the proposed method gives the economical predictions and outperforms the traditional deep neural network.},

The rise of big data with machine learning in recent years makes it a potential solution. This paper proposes two new energy load forecasting methods, enhancing the traditional sequence to sequence long short-term memory (S2S-LSTM) model. Method 1 integrates S2S-LSTM with human behavior patterns recognition, implemented and compared by 3 types of algorithms: density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), K-means and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Among them, PCC is proven to be better than the others and suitable for a large number of residential customers. Method 2 further improves Method 1's performance with a modified multi-layer Neural Network architecture, which is constituted by fully-connected, dropout and stable improved softmax layers. It optimizes the process of supervised learning in LSTM and improves the stability and accuracy of the prediction model. The performances of both proposed methods are evaluated on a dataset of 8-week electricity consumptions from 2337 residential customers.},

However, educators have not used this technological tool as extensively even though they acquire a large amount of student data. Similar to business owners, it is helpful for administrators in higher education to understand their student/customer base in order to meet their needs and retain them. The author obtained student addresses at both a Midwestern and Western university and mapped them onto a GIS system. Spatial analysis was used to determine whether there were geographic differences among students who dropped out of school, remained enrolled, or successfully graduated within six years of matriculation. Differences were found among the student groups. Geographic distance did not make a difference for dropouts or graduates. However, living near the universities was significant for students who remained in school. Proximity to classes is important for many students to continue their education and ultimately graduate. Additional research using GIS can assist educators in finding off-site campus locations near the greatest concentration of students.},
