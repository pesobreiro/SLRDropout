<h2>Dierkes et al_2011_Estimating the effect of word of mouth on churn and cross-buying in the mobile 
<!-- 5 passages, 886 characters --></h2>

<p> We use customers' anonymized call detail records as a way of modeling WOM (at point 4169)</p>

<p>analyze the impact of WOM on a specific purchase decision based on anonymized customer calling records of a mobile phone provider (at point 4429)</p>

<p>The mobile phone carrier sells games to be played on handsets as a service and it appears that customers who purchase these games are highly connected (at point 4560)</p>

<p>The analysis of game downloads and the impact of WOM on this buying decision provides another context to study the effect of WOM (at point 4712)</p>

<p> we analyze whether WOM has an impact on customer behavior or not. Based on the data set, we analyze if customer churn or game purchasing decisions of individuals in previous periods have an impact on the churn or purchase decisions of their neighbors, i.e., other customers whom the target customer interacted with either via a voice call, short message service (SMS), or multimedia message service (MMS) (at point 9014)</p>


<h2>Hung et al_2006_Applying data mining to telecom churn management 
<!-- 1 passages, 320 characters --></h2>

<p>This research focuses on the former. It intends to illustrate how to apply IT technology to facilitate telecom churn management. Specifically, this research uses data mining techniques to find a best model of predictive churn from data warehouse to prevent the customers turnover, further to enhance the competitive edge (at point 3491)</p>
