\section{Methodology}
\begin{comment}
Dropout predicting is challenging analysis process which requires appropriate approaches to address the dropout. Existing approaches are applied in different areas such as education, telecommunications, retail, social networks, and banking services. The goal is to identify customers in the risk of dropout to support retention strategies. This research developed a systematic literature review to evaluate the development of existing studies to predict dropout using machine learning,  following the guidelines recommended by Kitchenham and Peterson. The systematic review followed three phases planning, conducting and reporting. The selection of the most relevant articles was based on the use of Active Systematic Review tool using artificial intelligence algorithms. The criteria identified 28 articles and several research lines where identified. Dropout is a transversal problem for several sectors of economic activity, where it can be taken countermeasures before it happens if detected early.

	\frametitle{Research questions}
	What is the current state of machine learning research in existing studies to predict dropout in contractual settings? Based in this question were identified the following questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RQ1: What studies have been published?;
		\item RQ2: Which algorithms have been used to predict the dropout?
		\item RQ3: What are the more relevant features related to predicting customer dropout?
		\item RQ4: When the dropout occurs? 
		\item RQ5: What is the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms to predict dropout?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{comment}
RQ1: aims to identify what researches have been published so far in the area. This will allow to understand the extent of the research being developed. 
RQ2: aim to identify which different types of machine learning algorithms used to predict the dropout (RQ2) to deep the knowledge of the approaches being used to address the dropout. 
RQ3: explores which features are being used to predict the dropout. 
RQ4: Intends to understand if the timing related to the customer dropout is considered, this question explores if any study explores the advantage of using survival analysis, considering that allows also to examine if an event occurs but also how long took to occur (Williams, 2008). This perspective entails the understanding if is also covered the timings of the dropout event in the potential research to be explored. 
RQ5: aims to identify the accuracy of machine learning algorithms to predict the dropout. The goal of the prediction in the dropout is to develop classification task,  according to Rätsch (2004) is to find a functional mapping between the input data X, describing the input pattern, to a class label Y, such that Y=f(X), where the aim is to accurately predict the correct label on unseen data. However should be used appropriate performance measures, e.g. if the data is imbalanced should be considered the use of accuracy (Chawla, Bowyer, Hall, & Kegelmeyer, 2002)

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
 		\item The telecommunications sector is the area where are being developed most of the studies, which identifies some research areas gaps that need to be addressed;
 		\item Algorithms to predict dropout using also survival analysis approaches is an area under researched, only three research papers, however  considering the number of citations these approaches getting the attention (Perianez et al., 2016);
 		\item The use of algorithms to explore the timings when the dropout will occur is an approach that could complement the dropout prediction, supporting the development of actions considering both the probability and when should be developed countermeasures to avoid the customer dropout
