# Research methodology
The importance to understand customer dropout and the diversity of employed algorithms requires an understanding of trends and existing problems to create a ground base of knowledge. For the development of the systematic literature review was adopted, the methodology applied by Kitchenham & Charters (2007) developed in three stages: Plan, Conduct and Report, as described in the following figure:

Research goals is to understand What is the current state of machine learning research studies to predict dropout in contractual settings? 
Based in this were identified five research questions to determine the main aspects related to the customer dropout with contractual settings:
```
RQ1. What studies have been published? 
RQ2. Which algorithms have been used to predict the dropout?
RQ3. What are the more relevant features related to predicting customer dropout? 
RQ4. When the dropout occurs? 
RQ5. What is the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms to predict dropout? 
```
